  <p class="place"><span class="smcap">Yokohama, Japan</span>, Oct. 10, 1889.</p>

  <div><img class="drop_cap" src="images/rw008.jpg" width="115"
  height="145" alt="" /></div>

  <p class="drop_cap">AT 9.50 <span class="smallcap">A.M.</span>, on the morning of the 8th of
  September I went aboard the vestibule train of the New York Central &amp; Hudson River
  Railroad, at Forty-second Street, New York; and having travelled on the principal
  railroads around the world, I can truly say that no train which has ever carried me has
  approached this one in luxurious ease, comfort, and safety. The train rolled into the
  Chicago depot at 9.50 the next morning&mdash;exactly twenty-four hours. I was detained
  in Chicago for two days, and then left by the Rock Island route for San Francisco.</p>
</div>
  <p>At Ogden, we were detained two days by the burning of a bridge built over a
  ravine&mdash;one hundred feet long and about the same<span class="pagenum"><a name=
  "Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span> height. The fire destroyed the massive
  snow-sheds and great trees for a long distance. The fire took place Friday. Telegrams
  were sent to Sacramento, and the next day word came that twenty-one car loads of
  material had been sent with mechanics to erect a new bridge.</p>

  <p>The new bridge was erected in four days. Our train was the first to pass over it,
  and I remarked how substantially the new erection had been constructed. We reached the
  summit at noon, and the Palace Hotel, San Francisco, at midnight.</p>

  <p>On the 21st of September we went aboard the steamer <i>Rio-de-Janeiro</i>, built for
  the southern trade&mdash;370 feet long, 38 feet wide, 3,500 tons&mdash;six tubular
  boilers, each 13 feet diameter, 10&frac12; feet long. I remarked what heavy consumers
  of coal such shaped boilers must be, and the engineer said there was no room to put in
  any other kind.</p>

  <p>I found myself the sole occupant of a large and well ventilated state-room. At 3
  <span class="smallcap">P.M.</span>, Captain Ward, standing on the bridge, gave the signal,
  and the voice of an officer sang out, "All ashore that's going." Several hundreds of
  Chinese men and a dozen women, in showy dresses, crowded the<span class=
  "pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span> wharf. The friends of the
  missionaries on the wharf sang a parting hymn. The big propeller started. A tug pulled
  the ship's bow around, and away we went on our voyage of 4,700 miles across the
  Pacific. We passed the Golden Gate and the Seal Islands&mdash;covered with huge
  seals&mdash;and then on towards our destination.</p>

  <p>I soon made the acquaintance of most of the passengers, forty-five in
  number&mdash;including fourteen missionaries of the Presbyterian Board, nice young
  people going out to their duties in China and Japan. I took my seat at the
  dining-table, and found that I had at my right an agreeable companion, a captain in the
  German army, and at the left a charming miss of ten, Bessie, daughter of J. De Romero,
  secretary of the Spanish Legation to China.</p>

  <p>The first week out was a rough one. The weather was bad, and the ship rolled
  fearfully, so that we could not walk on deck. The waves were immense, and consequently
  nearly every one was sick. I felt a little nausea for a couple of days, but soon did
  duty regularly at the fine feast placed before us three times a day, the specialty
  being splendid California fruits&mdash;peaches, plums,<span class="pagenum"><a name=
  "Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span> grapes, and oranges, any of which would bring a
  prize in an agricultural show.</p>

  <p>Day after day the tireless engine drove the propeller. The splendid ship rushed on
  and on, not a moment's stop the entire distance. Not a sail or a steamer seen from port
  to port, and not even a whale. Once some porpoises and flying-fish, and once, when a
  thousand miles from land, a land-hawk lighted on the cross-trees, and proceeded
  leisurely to feast on a captured bird, and during the night flew away.</p>

  <p>The never-ending water was very impressive in its desolation. Better weather came,
  the ship was steady, and we could walk on deck. My little friend and I romped along the
  deck from end to end in safety, but once a rude wave threw us down, and dashed us
  against the sides of the vessel, taking off some inches of skin from me, but the child
  was unhurt, and I did not mind a little thing like that.</p>

  <p>I had early made the acquaintance of Mr. Mathews, the chief engineer, and once went
  into the hold and inspected the boilers and machinery of the huge ship. I spent a good
  deal of time in the chief engineer's room, listening to strange tales of ship and
  shore.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span></p>

  <p>On the 9th inst., as we were approaching our destination, I was shown an engrossed
  resolution complimenting the captain, beautifully illustrated with a pen-and-ink sketch
  of the ship by Se&ntilde;or Romero. After dinner, one of the passengers was selected to
  make the presentation address. He said:</p>

  <p>"Ladies and gentlemen, fellow-passengers by the good ship <i>Rio-de-Janeiro</i>: I
  act with pleasure as chairman on this auspicious occasion, and congratulate you on the
  near termination of our long trip across the great Pacific Ocean, rendered safe by the
  skill of the navigators and pleasant by the efforts of the officers, one and all. I
  have been many times across many seas, sometimes in magnificent floating palaces, but
  never on one so neat and clean, and where every detail has been so carefully attended
  to.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="stanza">
      <div class="verse">"'O'er the glad waters of the dark blue sea,</div>
      <div class="verse">Our thoughts as boundless and our souls as free,</div>
      <div class="verse">Far as the breeze can bear, the billows foam,</div>
      <div class="verse">Survey our empire and behold our home.'</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

  <p>"Our only home indeed for a brief period of time. But who can fail to remember the
  pleasant acquaintances made, even if we go around the world? For 'they that go
  down<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span> to the sea in
  ships; that do business in great waters; these see the works of the Lord, and his
  wonders in the deep.' Even if we look upon the lofty Himalayas, the Alps, the
  Apennines, and the Juras, and linger about gigantic Mont Blanc and her white-robed
  sisters, or the beautiful Jungfrau, or sail along the classic shores of the blue
  Mediterranean,&mdash;wherever we go, and whatever we see, the scenes on this good ship
  will be photographed, as it were, on our memories as long as we live&mdash;the romps on
  the deck, perchance with a charming miss; or the tramp, tramp with military regularity
  with those of mature age; the hours of looking upon the moonlit sea, listening to the
  song and music of our missionary friends. God bless them and their cause!</p>

  <p>"The temporary annoyance of sea-sickness will be forgotten. And now,
  fellow-passengers and friends, let us resolve that, like the passion-flower of the
  wilderness, which always bears within its bosom the true cross, we will bear within our
  bosom the true cross of 'enmity towards none, charity and goodwill for all,' and thus
  we shall be an honor to ourselves, the dear ones at home, the country we came from, and
  our God.</p>

  <p>"Captain Ward, by directions of the passengers on this ship, permit me to present to
  you an engrossed resolution, signed by all of us, and beautifully illustrated by
  Se&ntilde;or Romero, and expressing the hope&mdash;which has been so often said before
  on like occasions&mdash;that your voyage through life may be as safe and pleasant as
  you have made ours. I bid you farewell."</p>

  <p>The captain made a suitable reply, and the company all stood up and drank his
  health.</p>

  <p>One more night on the ship; and the next morning we sighted land and passed along
  near it for forty miles. It was a rough country, evidently of volcanic formation, and
  not so thickly populated as I expected to see, considering that there are thirty-eight
  million people in Japan. At last we cast anchor in the splendid harbor of Yokohama, one
  of the most commodious and beautiful in the world, where a tug took us off the ship. We
  were detained an hour or two at the custom-house, and then each took a
  <i>jinrickisha</i>, a low, two-wheeled chaise with a man between the shafts, who
  trotted up to the "Grand," the most perfect of hotels. We went directly to our rooms,
  which had been previously engaged.</p>

  YOKOHAMA.</h3>

  <p class="place"><span class="smcap">Yokohama</span>, Oct. 12, 1889.</p>

  <div><img class="drop_cap" src="images/rw015.jpg" width="115"
  height="153" alt="" /></div>

  <p class="drop_cap">THE Grand Hotel, where I am located, is very large and first-class in all
  respects. It is two hundred feet long, fronting the matchless bay, with an extension
  along a canal of two hundred feet.</p>
</div>
  <p>From the room I occupy, I look down upon the canal and a fine bridge which spans it.
  Across this bridge goes a constant procession of men, women, and children, some horses
  and carriages, and occasionally a single ox drawing a cart. But every thing looks so
  different, and is managed so differently from what one has been accustomed to, that I
  am more and more impressed with the idea that I am no longer in this world, but in some
  wonderland beyond the stars.</p>

  <p>The view of the bay from the front of the hotel is said to be, by some, the finest
  in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span> world. The
  harbor is very large, and could float all the navies of all nations. At anchor, in
  different directions, are iron-clad war-ships, English, French, German, Italian,
  Russian, and Japanese,&mdash;only one showing the stars and stripes, the <i>St.
  Mary</i>, an old side-wheel boat, about as large as a Brooklyn ferry-boat, and of
  course about as useless.</p>

  <p>One of the naval vessels flying the British flag is an immense iron-clad of six
  thousand tons. With the commander, Captain May, I became acquainted. He has on board an
  Armstrong gun of one hundred and twenty tons, the largest I think ever made, which will
  throw a bolt of half a ton a dozen miles, and penetrate through a wrought-iron plate
  twelve inches thick.</p>

  <p>The captain expressed himself as having serious doubt of the efficiency of such
  monster ships and guns in actual warfare, as smaller, swifter crafts could run around
  them, and have great advantages in that respect.</p>

  <p>Most of the coal used in this part of the world comes from England, and is
  consequently very high-priced.</p>

  <p>The harbor is crowded with many large passenger steamers, and a great fleet
  of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span> fishing
  craft. Towards evening the latter presented a beautiful appearance, coming in.</p>

  <p>I took a short walk beyond the canal and over steep hills. There are few horses or
  oxen to be seen. Most of the transportation is done by men. A two-wheeled cart, loaded
  with perhaps five hundred brick, was being pushed up a steep hill by eight men, who
  rested often and were much fatigued by their exertions.</p>

  <p>Last evening our party started for a moonlight excursion along the smooth and finely
  macadam-paved streets of the city. Under the guidance of one of our number,
  <i>jinrickishas</i>&mdash;the national cab for transporting light packages and
  passengers&mdash;were called, The translation of this word is <i>pullman-car</i>, and
  thus we have the extraordinary coincidence of the same name for a crude vehicle, drawn
  by a man, and for the splendid Pullman palace cars of America, which, with the Wagner,
  so far surpass in elegance and comfort all others.</p>

  <p>Away we went at a tremendous pace, each having a Chinese lantern, my carriage
  leading. We passed through well-lighted streets, lined with stores filled with showy
  goods, into the suburbs, a mile or two away, and stopped at a tea-house, where we were
  received<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span> with
  much bowing and ceremony by the women in charge, who spoke a little English. We were
  shown up a narrow stair-way into a small hall, and a bargain was made for a national
  performance by two musicians and ten dancing girls, who presently appeared, draped in
  beautiful Japanese costumes. These dancing girls were all very pretty, with their
  almond eyes and dark skins, and apparently not more than twelve or fifteen years old.
  They were the most jolly and laughing young women one ever saw. They shook hands with
  all the company, and then danced very nicely, to very poor music, in their swaying
  robes. At a signal, these robes were thrown aside, and the girls appeared in long loose
  dresses made of white and red material, much like the stripes on the American flag. The
  dancing, which was very graceful, continued for some time; but the show became somewhat
  monotonous. The ladies did not care to see any thing more, and we came away. Again we
  took to the road, making a very unique procession by moonlight&mdash;passing over many
  bridges and boulevards, and rows upon rows of brilliantly illuminated
  tea-houses,&mdash;and returned to the hotel.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span></p>

  <p>The natives do not wear European clothing as much as I expected. The upper part of
  their persons is covered with a loose sack, often open in front, and the jolly and
  laughing children of ten years and under are generally entirely nude.</p>

  <p>This morning all hands took another trip through the markets. We examined cane
  factories, and stores filled with silks and beautiful goods of native manufacture.
  Again we looked upon the street scenes and their never-ending wonders.</p>

  <p>From my bedroom window I see a large factory for the making of ice, which is sold at
  a penny a pound and is the greatest of comforts in this country. Butter and cigars are
  so strong and bad that I have left off the use of them, and do not expect to try them
  again until I get to Austria; but soda-water of excellent quality is to be had
  everywhere, and is a great comfort.</p>

  <p>We spent the evening listening to the splendid Japanese Marine Band which played
  lovely music for two hours in front of the hotel; all the musicians were natives. It
  was gayly bright at the hotel, the entire front being illuminated by paper lanterns of
  various colors; the big ships in the bay shown by their own numerous lamps, and the
  light<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span> of the
  full moon glittering upon the moving waters. I have seen no such beautiful show since
  1887, when, at the city of Florence, I witnessed great festivities attendant upon the
  unveiling of a statue to an Italian patriot; the great dome of the cathedral, the
  bridges, and the boats on the river Arno, the palaces on the hills, and the whole
  beautiful city being illuminated in the most splendid manner&mdash;but this is a
  digression and I must write now about Japan.</p>

  <p>I have to-day wandered about the city alone, and have seen more of the well-to-do
  natives. These are better dressed&mdash;always the flowing dressing-gown pattern, and
  stilted and inconvenient slipper-like shoes.</p>

  <p>Everywhere, the babies are carried in bags, on the backs of their mothers, or more
  often by the older children. There are great numbers of babies to be seen all over the
  city, carried about in this way, and they always appear very happy, well fed, and
  comfortable.</p>

  <p>This morning at two o'clock I was awakened by an earthquake which rolled my bed
  about the room. It lasted twenty seconds or so, but I did not think it worth while to
  get up, and soon went off to sleep again. I am told such entertainments are frequent in
  this country, and one must get used to them.</p>

  TOKIO.</h3>

  <p class="place"><span class="smcap">Tokio, Japan</span>, Oct. 15, 1889.</p>

  <div><img class="drop_cap" src="images/rw021.jpg" width="115"
  height="145" alt="" /></div>

  <p class="drop_cap">AFTER being entertained at Yokohama, on the morning of the 14th instant,
  with a slight earthquake, we left for this, the capital city of the Empire, on a finely
  built and equipped, narrow-gauge (3 ft. 6 in.) railroad. Every square yard of the
  country we traversed was cultivated in the highest degree&mdash;Distance eighteen
  miles, time one hour.</p>
</div>
  <p>I noticed that the locomotives, cars, and all the equipments about the railroad were
  of English manufacture from Manchester and Birmingham. I was informed that most of the
  twelve hundred miles of railroads in Japan were owned and run by the Government. The
  chief in charge is a native educated in England, who scouted the idea that<span class=
  "pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span> any other country could
  produce any thing fit to be used on railroads.</p>

  <p>We had previously engaged rooms at one of the two hotels in the city, where
  foreigners are entertained, and after an excellent dinner, took <i>jinrickishas</i>, of
  which there are 80,000 in this city, and had a long run through the interminable
  streets. The city has a population of 1,600,000 and covers a space of thirty-six square
  miles, the streets being very narrow and the houses mostly of wood, one and two stories
  high&mdash;the stores all small.</p>

  <p>After passing through streets for some miles, we came to others, wider and lighted
  brilliantly by gas and electricity, through which carriages were not allowed to pass.
  The houses, for miles, were occupied as tea-houses, and were brilliantly illuminated,
  like the gin palaces of London, or the whiskey saloons of America. Great vans were
  passing along, on which dancing and theatrical performances were going on. There were
  also a good many theatres in active operation.</p>

  <p>One of the evenings that we were in the city, these streets were occupied by an
  immense annual flower show, one of the features of<span class="pagenum"><a name=
  "Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span> which was a big elephant constructed of
  chrysanthemum flowers of many colors. The effect was very gorgeous.</p>

  <p>The next day we spent going about the great city and seeing its wonders, chief of
  which is the Mikado's palace and grounds. I called on the American Minister and asked
  him to get me a permit to go into the palace, but he said it was impossible, no
  foreigners being allowed in the palace or the grounds. The palace and gardens looked
  like immense fortifications, being surrounded by three moats, each a hundred feet wide,
  and filled with water, and by three stone walls, each thirty or forty feet high.</p>

  <p>The palace is in the heart of the city, and I should say the grounds were two
  hundred acres in extent, all, including the neighboring streets, being lighted by the
  New York Edison Company. I saw the superintendent who had charge of the construction of
  the plant, who said it took them a year to do it.</p>

  <p>The women to be seen in the streets and tea-houses are invariably small and very
  pretty, except some of the married ones, who have their teeth colored black in
  accordance with an ancient custom, which makes them look hideous.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span></p>

  <p>It is very cool in this part of Japan at this season. There is not sufficient frost
  to affect the crops, but one gets cold riding about&mdash;and there is no efficient
  method of heating the houses. There is no coal used for domestic purposes, and wood is
  very scarce and high. If you ask for a fire, at most hotels, they bring you a copper
  pan containing ignited charcoal covered with ashes, which does about as much good as a
  kerosene lamp. I suffer greatly with the cold, and would be glad to pay a large price
  for a pair of Arctic overshoes.</p>

  <p>The price of newspapers, printed in the English language, at Yokohama is twenty-five
  cents a copy, or thirty dollars per annum. They have very little news, and almost none
  from America.</p>

  <p>We went through the museum, and saw many extraordinary curiosities of ancient and
  modern Japan. Among them was a stuffed rooster in a glass case, whose tail feathers
  were ten feet long. I thought there was some humbug about it, but I afterwards saw a
  live one with tail feathers twelve feet long.</p>

  <p>The public buildings are modern, large, and handsome, and the people very
  polite<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span> and
  good-natured. The streets are narrow. Great crowds are everywhere. It seems to me that
  I must have seen a hundred thousand people to-day. Every thing about the city is
  strange, often disagreeable and offensive. A couple of days in it is quite sufficient,
  and I shall be very glad to go away to-morrow.</p>

  <div><img class="drop_cap" src="images/rw026.jpg" width="115"

  <p class="drop_cap2">WE left Tokio on the 17th, at 6.46 <span class="smallcap">A.M.</span>, for a
  station called Utsumorama, ninety-three miles. Arrived at noon, and, after an excellent
  lunch, started in <i>jinrickishas</i> for this place, and a most extraordinary and
  unique trip it proved to be.</p>
</div>
  <p>The road was built hundreds of years ago by a Shinto king, and is an admirable
  example of engineering; well drained, and with an excellent foundation of small stones,
  which needed only a top-dressing and a steam roller to make it as good as any in
  Europe. It is lined on both sides with immense pine and cedar trees. Many of these
  trees are twelve feet in diameter; and often the roots are grown together, so that four
  or five trees look like one. They are sixty to eighty feet high, and afford an
  excellent shade.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span></p>

  <p>The distance from the railway station to this place is twenty-five miles, and we
  made it in four hours with two men harnessed to the <i>jinrickishas</i> tandem. We made
  only one stop of half an hour for lunch, which we brought with us, and ate at one of
  the numerous tea-houses.</p>

  <p>We arrived at 4 <span class="smallcap">P.M</span>., delighted at the wonderful sights,
  but much fatigued and very cold. Rooms had been engaged for us in an excellent hotel,
  excellent in all respects except that there was no way of heating, unless with pans of
  charcoal. I suffered greatly from the cold, though I had warm clothing, including a
  heavy overcoat which had done me good service the previous winter at Montreal when the
  thermometer stood at thirty degrees below zero.</p>

  <p>Near the hotel are a dozen, or more, costly and grotesque edifices, much adorned
  with carved wood statues of horrible-looking beasts and devils, covered with bronze and
  gold. There are temples of Buddha, and gorgeous mausoleums of kings who died five
  hundred years ago, situated in a park of big trees; but looking at them, though
  interesting, was not agreeable, and I was quite satisfied with one visit.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span></p>

  <p>To-day we made an excursion to a lake among the mountains, five thousand feet high.
  I was furnished with a mountain horse which proved an ugly brute; kicked and stumbled,
  and put the bit between his teeth, so that I could not control him, and he nearly
  trotted the life out of me. We went up and along the winding paths, passing numerous
  water-falls, one of which was 750 feet high, and at last reached the lake, which is of
  great beauty. The mountains rise directly from the water's edge. They are covered to
  their very tops with green trees, the leaves of which have a singular feathery
  appearance.</p>

  <p>The tea-houses where we stopped for lunch were models of cleanliness and comfort. We
  brought our own provisions as usual, but had in addition a boiled fish just taken from
  the lake.</p>

  <p>We stopped in and around the tea-houses for some hours; and then I mounted my ugly
  brute of a horse and rode back to the hotel, a much used-up man. I was glad to get a
  bath and to retire early.</p>

  <p>We returned to the railway station by the road we came, and again made the distance
  in four hours, with only one stop of fifteen minutes.</p>

  <div><img class="drop_cap" src="images/rw029.jpg" width="115"
  height="154" alt="" /></div>

  <p class="drop_cap">YESTERDAY at 10 <span class="smallcap">A.M.</span> we left Yokohama, arrived
  at the railroad station at twelve, and reached this favorite watering-place, among the
  mountains, in four hours by <i>jinrickishas</i>. Our rooms had been engaged in an
  excellent hotel, called Fujiya, and soon after our arrival a fine dinner was served of
  soup, fish, roast beef, sago pudding, and other delicacies, to which we did ample
  justice. The waitresses were all pretty native girls, dressed in their native costumes;
  there were a dozen, or more, of them about the hotel. These waitresses were pleasant,
  jolly, and very polite, but very small in stature; some of them walked under my
  outstretched arm, and all of them might have done so.</p>
</div>
  <p>I have a fine front room, and look out upon the surrounding mountains, which
  are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span> very lofty
  and covered with green trees. This is an ideal mountain resort&mdash;great mountains, a
  roaring river winding some hundreds of feet below the road, and numerous water-falls;
  the water rushing down into the river. From one point of view I counted seven
  water-falls, and found, on trial, that one of them came from a hot spring far up among
  the mountains, and the water was quite warm when it reached the road. I walked along
  the road for several miles and found it wonderfully romantic everywhere. The road
  itself is a fine specimen of engineering, very expensive to build, and almost as good
  as the famous one built by Napoleon III., from Geneva to Chamouni.</p>

  <p>We are here rather too late in the season to thoroughly enjoy the place and
  surroundings, it being cold and the methods of heating houses imperfect, but in summer
  it must be perfectly lovely.</p>

  <p>There is another hotel being erected near the one we are in, and I was much
  interested watching their method of work. They required a lot of earth for filling in,
  and were transporting it in baskets from the mountains above. Two men would fill a
  basket, suspend it across their shoulders by a bamboo<span class="pagenum"><a name=
  "Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span> pole, dump it where wanted, and return for
  more. I longed to present them with a wheelbarrow, and show them how to move earth ten
  times faster than they were doing. It would appear that there are no saw-mills in this
  country, for the men were sawing out boards and timber by hand, to use in the
  construction of this hotel. A stick of timber a foot or two in diameter was arranged
  with one end resting on the ground, and the other placed on a wooden horse four or five
  feet high; a man then mounted the stick and laboriously sawed out boards with a
  hand-saw. The workmen had no clothing on except a breech cloth, and were all doing
  constant and faithful service for, as we were informed, ten hours a day; the pay being
  ten cents per day. For similar service in our country, as every one knows, mechanics
  are paid from $2.50 to $3.50 per day.</p>

  <p>We left the hotel at nine this morning, and took a trip among the mountains to Lake
  Hakone. I selected my horse this time, and he proved an excellent animal, a small
  shaggy fellow, kind and easy trotting, but much given to stumbling and letting both
  heels fly if another horse came near, which little amusement of his nearly
  unseated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span> me
  several times. We went up six thousand feet over the worst of mountain roads, but my
  animal walked carefully, often along narrow paths, where a fall would have tumbled us
  down hundreds of feet below. I enjoyed the ride very much. It took six horses and seven
  chairs to accommodate our party, each horse having a man to attend to him, and each
  chair carried by four men, making a large procession. We arrived in two or three hours
  at an hotel on the lake, and after an excellent lunch took boats and crossed over to
  near the foot of Fusiyama, the horses and men going around to meet us.</p>

  <p>Fusiyama is the brag mountain of Japan, the only one of much size in the Empire, and
  is universally known and photographed in all possible ways. It is fourteen thousand
  feet high, and is, as I write, covered with snow, and presents a beautiful appearance
  from the lake.</p>

  <p>We landed and walked over the mountains to the place where the horses had been sent.
  The sun was terribly hot in some places, and in others the only path was along the bed
  of dry brooks. We passed over the crater of an active volcano, steam and smoke rushing
  out near the path.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg
  26]</a></span> The guide said it was dangerous to wander from the path, and pointed out
  where two native guides had fallen through and had not been seen since. There was no
  wandering after this fact was stated. After two or three hours of dreadful fatigue, we
  found our horses, and I was very glad to mount my shaggy old fellow, who carried me
  safely over slippery rocks, along narrow paths, and a road (where there was any) as bad
  as a road could be, arriving at the hotel at six, much fatigued, but in good form and
  ready for the excellent dinner which was waiting our arrival.</p>

  <p>After thoroughly enjoying this delightful spot for two days, we started down the
  mountain road in the morning and came along in <i>jinrickishas</i> at a tremendous
  pace, making the distance&mdash;fourteen and one half miles&mdash;to the railroad in
  two hours. We reached Yokohama at 7 <span class="smallcap">P.M.</span>, in season for a
  fine dinner.</p>

  <p class="drop_cap">ON the 2d inst. we left Yokohama by the Japanese steamer <i>Omi Mars</i>,
  Captain Island Vrise. During the afternoon we passed an island on which is a volcano in
  eruption. It is 2,550 feet high, and was a pretty sight as seen from the steamer. We
  arrived at this fine city at 5 <span class="smallcap">P.M.</span>, and were soon in
  comfortable quarters at an excellent hotel, and, as it was very cold, I had a grate
  fire in my room, which I enjoyed very much. The city is beautifully situated near the
  shore with great mountains for a background, and the harbor is very fine. As usual, big
  steamers and crafts of all kinds were to be seen, representing England, France, Italy,
  Russia, and other countries&mdash;but Stars and Stripes there were none.</p>
</div>
  <p>We left on the 4th by rail for Kioto,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id=
  "Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span> arriving there at 5 <span class="smallcap">P.M.</span>, at a
  really splendid hotel, as fine as any in Europe. The city is a very old one, and one of
  the largest and most interesting in Japan; great numbers of temples and palaces, and,
  in and around it, most lovely scenery. Some of the temples were erected seven hundred
  years ago. In the evening I went with a party and called on the American missionaries,
  who were holding a monthly meeting at one of their houses. They have a large college
  building, and all seem greatly interested in their work.</p>

  <p>The next morning we started early to make the famous Oigawa Rapids excursion. The
  entire party, except two ladies, went in <i>jinrickishas</i>, over bad roads and
  through immense fields of rice, vegetables, and tea-plants, up and along a rough
  mountain road. Once my cooly's carelessness tipped me over, but, as good luck would
  have it, toward the cliff and not into the rushing river, and no harm was done. We had
  to leave the vehicles several times, the road having been badly washed out a month ago
  by a big typhoon, which caused floods and great disasters all over the island. Some
  thousands of lives were lost, and there was great destruction of property.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span></p>

  <p>We stopped once to rest, and then went through fields for a mile or two to the river
  Hodza, where we took three flat-bottomed boats, manned by three boatmen each, and
  passed down over numerous rapids, and through what in California would be called a
  ca&ntilde;on&mdash;mountains from two thousand to three thousand feet high, clothed
  with verdure to their tops. The river is from two hundred to three hundred feet wide
  and full of rocks, and was really, it appeared to me, very dangerous; but the boatmen
  were skilful, and we did the distance, seven miles, in one and one half hours. We had
  lunch at a tea-house, and returned by another route to the city, passing through other
  fields and seeing an immense number of children everywhere. We arrived at the hotel at
  5 <span class="smallcap">P.M.</span>, the excursion being pronounced by all to have been
  the most interesting we had enjoyed in Japan.</p>

  <p>On the 6th inst. we left the city at 9 <span class="smallcap">A.M.</span> in
  <i>jinrickishas</i>, and passed along a splendid wide national road for seven miles, to
  Lake Viwa. We met great crowds of people on foot coming to the city, and numerous
  trucks loaded with stone, timber, rice, and vegetables. Occasionally a single
  bullock<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span> would be
  drawing the vehicles, but generally this was done by two or four men. We met two
  processions of ten trucks, each loaded with stone. The trucks were drawn by prisoners,
  with a soldier to guard each truck. The prisoners were comfortable-looking, and
  appeared as jolly as any of the travellers. They were building a canal from the lake to
  Kioto, nine miles long, four miles of which they said was a tunnel. I examined a part
  of it, and found it to be of excellent construction. We arrived at the lake at noon.
  After lunch we went aboard a small steamer, and proceeded to a point where there was a
  famous temple, and landed. But looking at temples in this country has become
  monotonous, and I spent my time sitting under a wonderful pine tree, which is feet
  eight in diameter, with limbs trained out for fifty feet horizontally each way. We
  steamed around the lake for an hour or two, and returned by the same road we went,
  reaching the hotel at six. I found a good fire in a stove in my room, which was very
  acceptable.</p>

  <p class="drop_cap2">WE left Kioto at 10 <span class="smallcap">A.M.</span> this morning by rail,
  and arrived in this remarkable city at 11.15. It is a most interesting place, having a
  large number of canals and bridges, in which respect it resembles Venice more than any
  other city. It is the second city in size and importance in the Empire, having about a
  million and a half of inhabitants, and numerous industries, such as cotton factories,
  etc.; also the imperial mint, which we visited.</p>
</div>
  <p>The machinery of this mint was all made in France&mdash;with one or two exceptions,
  of English make&mdash;and is very fine. This is the most exclusively native city we
  have visited, there being only seven resident foreigners, and only one American, from
  Charlestown,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
  Mass., who is here for two years to superintend the erection of a brush factory.</p>

  <p>There are numerous large boats constantly passing through the canals, heavily loaded
  with cotton and all kinds of goods, showing an extensive commerce. Toward evening I
  took a walk across a long bridge, and rested myself on a seat in a small park
  overlooking the river; but the people stopped their work to look at me to such an
  extent as to make it disagreeable, and I returned to the hotel. The next morning we
  returned to our old quarters in the hotel at Kob&eacute;.</p>

  <div><img class="drop_cap" src="images/rw040.jpg" width="115"
  height="154" alt="" /></div>

  <p class="drop_cap">LEAVING Kob&eacute; on the evening of the 8th, by the Peninsular and
  Oriental steamer <i>Ancona</i>, we arrived here at seven this evening. This line of
  steamers has the contract for transporting the English mails all over the Eastern
  waters, including Australia, Japan, and China, and has in commission fifty-four
  vessels, some of them of 6,000 tons, representing 7,000 horse-power.</p>
</div>
  <p>On the 14th and 15th we were steaming through the famous inland sea, the beauty of
  which could hardly be exaggerated by a writer of a poetical turn of mind,&mdash;passing
  between Nipon, a large island, on one side, and many hundred smaller ones on the other.
  The channel would often be near the shores, where we could see the villages and
  cultivated land. The islands being volcanic,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id=
  "Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span> were in all sorts of fantastic shapes; one called the
  Asses'-ears was very funny-looking. The water is very clear and blue, the islands
  largely cultivated and clothed with green to the summits of their mountains.</p>

  <p>On the morning of the 15th, the steamer dropped her anchor at Nagasaki, and we all
  went ashore sight-seeing and shopping. We rode about through long streets, and called
  at several factories and stores; among others, at a place where was made a variety of
  shell-work, which was very pretty. I made some purchases.</p>

  <p>The owner of the place spoke English, and I recommended him to send an exhibition of
  his goods to the fair which was expected to be opened in New York in 1892, and he
  astonished me by asking what country New York was in? But life being too short for me
  to teach him the rudiments of geography, I paid for my purchase, and came away.</p>

  <p>We went to see more temples. In the grounds near one of them were two small trees
  and on a stone near it was engraved, "Planted by Mr. and Mrs. Gen. Grant, 1879."</p>

  <p>We had an excellent lunch at the Hotel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id=
  "Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span> Bellevue, took another trip around the city, and came back
  to the ship at 6 <span class="smallcap">P.M.</span></p>

  <p>The harbor is one of great beauty, nearly landlocked, and surrounded by hills
  covered with verdure. It was crowded with ships, three Russian men-of-war, one
  American, and several English.</p>

  <p>Nothing could have been more lovely than the trip from Nagasaki to this
  port&mdash;the sea as smooth as a pond, weather warm, and every thing quite agreeable
  and comfortable.</p>

  <p>We came up the bay last evening between four and six. It was a splendid show. One of
  the finest harbors in the world, eleven miles long and from two to five wide. The
  islands and mountains covered with verdure.</p>

  <p>The island of Hong-Kong was taken possession of by the British after the war with
  China in 1842, and now has a population of one hundred and forty thousand.</p>

  <p>We left the steamer after dark in a tug, and had a fine view of the city of
  Victoria; the streets and buildings covering the hills for a long distance, and the
  vessels in the harbor being brilliantly lighted, presented a splendid appearance as we
  approached.</p>

  <p>We soon took possession of rooms previously engaged at the Hong-Kong Hotel,
  and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span> found it to
  be in all respects first-class, including an Otis elevator furnished by their London
  house. The waiters are all Chinese, tall and good-looking, and dressed in long blue
  night-gowns or frocks.</p>

  <p>This city surpasses Gibraltar in the number of nationalities one sees in the
  streets; every nation on earth appearing to be represented, and I am much interested in
  looking at them as they pass.</p>

  <p>The policemen are a sight&mdash;tall, black fellows from the Malay Peninsula. Their
  uniform is the same as worn by those in New York, except a large red turban, which
  gives them a very imposing appearance.</p>

  <p>Passing for a mile or so alongside the water front between 5 and 6 <span class=
  "smallcap">P.M.</span> I found that hundreds of boats had returned from fishing, or other
  business, and were tied to the piers, bows on, giving me a chance to see this phase of
  Chinese life, which had always interested me when reading about it. They were all
  having their suppers,&mdash;a family of ten, sitting in a circle with a big bowl of
  food, apparently rice, in the centre. Each person had a small bowl, which was often
  replenished, and the food eaten with chopsticks. The boat was their home, their
  sole<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span> residence.
  In one case a small boy was eating and his mother was boxing his ears very roughly.
  Except the children, no one paid any attention to me; this being an English city the
  people are accustomed to foreigners.</p>

  <p>One morning we called <i>jinrickishas</i> and went on a ten minutes' trip to the
  foot of the mountains, which are back of the city, and there entered a cable tramway
  car, which took us up a very steep incline, a mile or so, to a station, and then we
  took sedan chairs and continued our trip to the top of Mount Victoria, 1,825 feet high.
  From there we looked down upon the bay, the city, many islands, and the mainland of
  China on the opposite shores&mdash;a scene of unsurpassed magnificence. The big
  steamers in the beautiful bay looked like canoes on the calm waters of an inland
  lake.</p>

  <p>The island is a series of mountains, over, around, and through which are built
  splendid roads, near which are many beautiful residences, where the governor and
  wealthy people reside.</p>

  <p>We looked about for a couple of hours and then took the tramway down. Some of the
  more timid of the party preferred to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id=
  "Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span> come all the way down in the sedans, and said they had a
  delightful trip.</p>

  <p>The sedan I was in was carried by two men, who were very picturesque, their bronze
  bodies shining in the sun. Their bare feet pressed the ground with a sure tread.
  Sometimes I have seen a sedan carried by four men with white trousers and red sacks,
  their heads covered by large bamboo hats, and altogether presenting a very attractive
  appearance.</p>

  <p>The thermometer on the top of Mount Victoria registered only sixty-five degrees, but
  I never felt such heat in July at home. However, when in Japan I suffered so much from
  cold weather that I am quite glad to have some of the other kind now.</p>

    CANTON.</h3>

  <p class="place"><span class="smcap">Canton, China</span>, Nov. 21, 1889.</p>

  <div><img class="drop_cap" src="images/rw046.jpg" width="115"
  height="149" alt="" /></div>

  <p class="drop_cap">FROM Hong-Kong we sailed on the 21st inst. at 8 <span class=
  "smallcap">A.M.</span>, for this city, by the fine English steamer <i>Hankow</i>, Captain
  Lloyd, and arrived at 2.30 <span class="smallcap">P.M.</span></p>
</div>
  <p>There being but one hotel here, the Oriental, and that a very poor one at that, we
  made use of the English passenger boats as hotels during our stay, and found them
  excellent in all ways; large, clean rooms and table very fine, including all kinds of
  wines and beer furnished gratis, and wood-cock, and snipe every day.</p>

  <p>Leaving the beautiful harbor of Hong-Kong, with its immense fortifications, we
  passed into the Canton River, a mile or two wide for many miles from its mouth, and
  having high mountains on each side, covered with green trees and grass. There
  were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span> great
  fortifications all along, armed with big Krupp guns. We saw large numbers of the
  national boats, called <i>sampans</i>, and many village, houses, and tents.</p>

  <p>As we approached Canton the river narrowed to about a thousand feet, and I was able
  to closely observe the country. Banana trees lined the shores for many miles,
  sugar-cane and rice fields stretched as far as I could see. Scattered all along the
  country and in the city big brick buildings one hundred feet square and six stories
  high were very prominent. These were pawnbrokers' establishments.</p>

  <p>As we approached the city, the largest building seen was a Catholic cathedral, with
  two great towers; a splendid edifice, but not yet finished.</p>

  <p>We had an excellent lunch on the steamer, and then went in sedan chairs to call on
  Mr. Charles Seymour, the United States Consul, and his wife. After being kindly
  entertained in their beautiful residence, we returned to the boat, and spent the
  remainder of the day and evening watching the wonderful life on the river.</p>

  <p>There was a ferry-house near, and I learned that the cost of ferrying across the
  river was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span> one
  fifth of a cent, and that a howling swell could have a boat alone for one and a half
  cents.</p>

  <p>After a good dinner at seven, and a good night's sleep, we all took sedan chairs,
  three men to each chair, the conductor ahead with the native guide, Ah Cum, a
  fine-looking Chinese gentleman with finger nails two inches long, and the entire day
  was spent in sight-seeing.</p>

  <p>All the streets of the city are from four to ten feet wide, no sidewalks, and are
  paved with granite blocks a foot wide and six feet long. The houses all have shops in
  front. We did not see one private house in the city outside of the foreign settlements.
  The buildings are mostly two stories high, built of brick, and the stores have no glass
  or other fronts; all open to the street.</p>

  <p>The streets are crowded with an immense mass of men, women, and children, nearly all
  with no clothing above their hips, and as our men pushed their way along, yelling and
  screaming, the people would stop, crowd around us with wonder, but were never
  impolite.</p>

  <p>We passed along many miles of streets, lined with stores of all kinds, the
  butchers'<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span> shops
  displaying dead rats hanging up, and once I saw the carcass of a large dog with the
  hair scalded off lying on the butcher's table ready to be cut up for customers.</p>

  <p>It has rained here for two days, and the streets are very dirty and bad-smelling.
  There is no system of sewerage, no horses or draft animals. Every thing, including all
  kinds of sewerage and slops and building materials, is carried along by men, women, and
  children. Frequently there were such masses of people going and coming that traffic
  would be clogged, and we had much difficulty in getting through.</p>

  <p>To write of all the extraordinary things I have seen to-day would require a big
  book, and I can therefore only mention that we went to a flour mill and saw them
  grinding wheat by stones forced around by blind oxen, just as they used to do in Bible
  times in Palestine.</p>

  <p>We went into a jail and saw poor wretches in irons with wooden collars around their
  necks; and on the street two of them were in the stocks, their hands and feet confined.
  The court-house was near, and some of our party attended a trial which had been
  progressing for some days. The wife of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id=
  "Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span> judge saw there were ladies in the party, and invited them
  into an interior room and entertained them with tea.</p>

  <p>The prisoner was accused of forging the deed of a house and land belonging to one of
  his wives, and selling her furniture, all valued at two thousand dollars. Several
  witnesses proved that all this was so, and the wife appeared with her marriage
  certificate. At the moment when our party arrived, the prisoner was on the stand. He
  denied that he was married to the woman or had ever sold any of her property. The judge
  was very angry, and said to the prisoner that he was the greatest liar in China, and
  ordered that he should be punished with 150 blows with a bamboo stick, then and there.
  He was thrown down, and held by several men, while another struck the blows with great
  severity on his bare back, causing the poor wretch to yell with agony, so that he could
  be heard far out on the street, as well as in the interior room, where the ladies were
  drinking tea. After fifty blows had been given, the man was asked to confess, but he
  refused and was given fifty more; and the native guide said that he would no doubt have
  his head cut off in a few days. We saw on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id=
  "Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span> our route a beautiful club-house, and a clock two hundred
  years old, made to go by water. Lunch was served in a splendid seven-story pagoda on a
  hill outside of the city wall, from the top of which we looked down upon one section of
  the city and an immense cemetery. A part of this was devoted to rich men's tombs, all
  above ground, the peculiarities of which were that the coffins were all in sight. After
  lunch we were again rushed through the crowded streets, stopping at many shops, some of
  the party purchasing largely of silks, satins, crockery, and curios; and at six we
  returned to the boat, a very much instructed but fatigued party.</p>

  <p>In the evening I was greatly interested in watching what was going on in the family
  boats, called <i>sampans</i>, which were anchored between our boat and the shore. I
  counted from the steamer 164 of them, with their sterns towards us. Each boat had a
  kerosene-oil stove, and in a frying-pan they were preparing their suppers, which
  consisted apparently of rice. I noticed that when the woman who was stirring the food
  wished to moisten it, she dipped water from the river, in which was floating all the
  filth of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
  great city. Each member of the family had a bowl which he dipped into the food, and
  proceeded to eat with chopsticks.</p>

  <p>There are many thousand of such boats on the river, the only homes of their
  occupants.</p>

  <p>We spent another day in Canton, going about in sedan chairs, steamers, and
  <i>sampans</i>, and saw many places and objects of interest; but two days have been
  quite enough for this city, and I was glad to get aboard the fine steamer <i>Honam</i>,
  Captain Febor, which left at 5.30 <span class="smallcap">P.M.</span>, and arrived at
  Hong-Kong at 1 <span class="smallcap">A.M.</span>, we all going directly to the rooms
  retained for us at the hotel. Here I had the pleasure of meeting a lady from New York,
  Mrs. R. H. L. Townsend, who is making a tour around the world, accompanied by another
  lady, and has accomplished the trip thus far without trouble, being everywhere received
  with distinguished consideration.</p>

  <div><img class="drop_cap" src="images/rw053.jpg" width="115"
  height="156" alt="" /></div>

  <p class="drop_cap2">WE have been detained here ten days, awaiting the arrival of a P. and O.
  steamer, for which we were booked, but have passed the time in a very delightful
  manner.</p>
</div>
  <p>I went nearly every day to the park and public gardens, of about twenty acres,
  situated several hundred feet above the main street, laid out in the best manner, and
  containing a great variety of trees and flowers, such as grow only in tropical
  climates. On one occasion a friend and myself were sitting on a bench near a handsomely
  dressed Chinese gentleman. My friend said: "See what a handsome girl is coming, and how
  beautifully she is dressed, but how deplorable that she has such little feet." I agreed
  with him, and said it was a pity such a pretty creature was obliged to submit to
  a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span> barbarous
  custom like that. The Chinese gentleman spoke to us in excellent English, and said: "Do
  you think so? That is my daughter, and while I agree with you, we feel obliged to make
  her feet small or no Chinese gentleman would marry her."</p>

  <p>We made apologies which were kindly accepted, and in a long conversation with the
  gentleman we learned much of China, he being a resident of Canton, who had been
  educated in the United States. I cannot agree with my Chinese friend that it will be so
  long a time before China will be opened to European civilization, for her 332,000,000
  people are beginning to feel the pressure of surrounding nations; Russia on the north,
  and England, Germany, France, and Italy on her sea-coasts, and above all the example of
  the wonderful advances made by Japan are having strong influences upon China. China has
  now for a Prime-Minister, Li Hung Chang, a very great man, the equal of Bismarck or
  Gladstone, and the young Emperor has very advanced ideas. Just now we read in the
  newspapers that Li Hung Chang had caused a system of railways to be laid out, to run
  all over the vast empire, but it appears that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48"
  id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span> the religious authorities have some sort of a veto on
  political actions, and because one of the gates at Pekin had been destroyed by fire,
  which they attributed to the anger of the gods on account of the attempt to build
  railroads, the invention of "foreign devils," they would not consent, and consequently
  the railroad plan was abandoned for the present. There is only one railroad in the
  Empire, up north, running from a coal mine to the sea, eighty miles long.</p>

  <p>The Emperor has, in his extensive palace grounds at Pekin, a miniature railroad,
  much like the one which was in the grounds of the Centennial Exposition at Philadelphia
  in 1876, with a locomotive and car attached, which was built and presented to him by
  the French, and he is said to be very much pleased riding about on it.</p>

  <p>I think it a misfortune to China, and to this country, that our great general,
  Ulysses S. Grant, was not permitted to live a few years longer, for through the great
  friendship of Li Hung Chang for him, and the high regard in which he was held, not only
  by all the rulers of the Asiatic countries, but by the people themselves, it is more
  than likely that we would have seen China opened<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49"
  id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span> to modern civilization, as Japan has been, and the
  United States of America reaping the advantages of close commercial relations with her,
  and at the same time amicably restricting the emigration of her people to this
  country.</p>

  <p>One afternoon we hired a steam yacht and went about the harbor and partly around the
  island. We stopped to examine a dry dock, where a large steamer was being repaired, and
  I was delighted to see that one of the big pumps used for pumping the water out of the
  dock was made by the A. S. Cameron Co., of New York, for you do not often see any thing
  in this part of the world to remind you of home,&mdash;kerosene oil, Singer's
  sewing-machines, and clocks being about all. The English appear to supply nearly every
  thing to the countless millions of this Eastern country, owing, of course, to the fact
  that their government does so much to forward the interests of her merchants and
  manufacturers, and I think it only right to say that wherever you see a British flag in
  this part of the world there follows it Christianity, civilization in all its advanced
  phases, and safety to life and property, and not anywhere is the great contrast
  between<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
  civilization and semi-barbarism shown so strongly as in the comforts and beauties of
  this lovely city as against the horrors of Canton.</p>

  <p>This is an important commercial city. The governor stated in a late message that it
  was the third or fourth export city in the world. There is a great deal of building
  going on up the mountains, the bricks for which are being carried from the vessels to
  their destinations by coolies, each man carrying two baskets suspended from a bamboo
  stick across his shoulders, each basket containing eighteen large bricks. The mountains
  are very steep, and the distance about two miles, so that the men can only make two or
  three trips a day, and their pay is five cents a trip.</p>

  <p>The fine winding roads were alive with these men; a thousand or more were to be seen
  at one time.</p>

  <div><img class="drop_cap" src="images/rw058.jpg" width="115"

  <p class="drop_cap">ON the 4th instant we left the beautiful island of Hong-Kong and the city
  of Victoria by the steamer <i>Kaisar-i-Hind</i> (Empress of India). The accommodations
  and appointments of the steamer were first-class&mdash;electric lights, plenty of ice,
  and every convenience.</p>
</div>
  <p>On Sunday morning the English service was read from the prayer-book by the captain
  to a congregation consisting of all of the officers and most of the passengers. Before
  this there was a parade of the crew and servants,&mdash;some sixty Lascars, black,
  sharp-looking fellows dressed in frocks and bright head-dresses, and looking very
  fine.</p>

  <p>Yesterday was very hot. We were nearing the equator, and the captain had punkas put
  up in the dining cabin. A Lascar boy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id=
  "Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span> pulled the strings running over pulleys and fanned us
  during meal times, which was very agreeable.</p>

  <p>Again I have to note how lonely these sea voyages are. Since we left Hong-Kong, five
  days, not a craft has been seen, only a wide waste of water, generally as smooth as a
  pond.</p>

  <p>The steamer arrived at seven in the morning, and was soon surrounded by boats, each
  containing two or three boys. The passengers threw silver pieces into the water, and
  the boys would dive after them, and seemed to get them every time. It was great fun to
  watch them. A little bald-headed fellow not more than six years old, attracted my
  attention, and I threw some bright pieces near his boat. Over he went and caught them
  every time, and was pulled into the boat by his older companion, triumphantly holding
  up the pieces.</p>

  <p>We came ashore and were soon in our rooms in the large and first-rate Hotel de
  l'Europe.</p>

  <p>We were within about fifty miles of the equator, and the heat was intense. After
  resting we took carriages, it being quite a comfort to have them once more, and
  drove<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span> over fine
  roads, past splendid government and other buildings, two or three miles out to a
  botanical garden, said to be one of the finest in the world, all in perfect order, with
  trees and plants such as can be seen only in the tropics; tall trees, with clusters of
  cocoa-nuts on them, and the fan palm, a great curiosity to me, being in the shape of a
  fan fifty feet high. Pine-apples were everywhere, for this is the home of that fine
  fruit; big trees, covered with red and white flowers, and plants of great variety and
  beauty, all in a park of a hundred acres or more; houses filled with fine orchids, and
  others containing beautiful native birds. It was very hot&mdash;ninety degrees or
  so&mdash;and oppressive, but we all stood it for a couple of hours, and most of our
  party, who had seen many such shows in all parts of the world, said that they had never
  seen any thing approaching this for variety and beauty. We then took our carriages and
  returned to the hotel for lunch, and immediately afterwards went on another tour around
  the well-built, handsome city. Fine stores and public buildings, perfect pavements,
  splendid turn-outs, and all the appliances of civilization were everywhere. No more
  babies carried pickapack, as in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg
  54]</a></span> Japan and China. They were often nude, but looked well cared-for,
  comfortable, and happy.</p>

  <p>The natives are of the Malay race, and their dress is of the brightest, generally a
  frock of white or red cotton and no trousers. We returned to the hotel at five, and
  after resting an hour had an excellent dinner. Being very hungry I partook of all the
  courses, the dinner being <i>&agrave; la Russe</i>. One incident was particularly
  tropical. The ceiling and sides of the dining-room were covered with little green
  lizards, crawling about and catching flies. Some of the ladies were nervous, fearing
  that the creatures might drop into the soup or on their hair, but I did not mind,
  knowing them to be harmless. The landlord, who has been here twenty-eight years, thinks
  that I should stay here at least a week and go on to the Malay Peninsula to shoot
  tigers, but I have concluded to postpone that kind of amusement until I come again. I
  find it best to be very temperate in this terribly hot country, limiting my beverages
  to soda and Apollinaris water, and am very thankful to have plenty of ice, which is now
  manufactured in this city and all other large cities in the East. The P. &amp; O.
  line<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span> of steamers
  alone spends one hundred thousand dollars annually for ice.</p>

  <p>When I retired at night I found that they had not provided me with even a sheet for
  a cover; only a mosquito net. The Chinese chamber-man was sleeping in front of my door,
  but I did not like to disturb him, so I turned in, and it being very hot I got along
  very well, and had a good night's rest.</p>

  <p>I was out early in the morning, and was greatly interested in looking at the sights
  of the city. They were making a park of large dimensions, fronting the water, and a
  hundred or more wagons were used to transport the dirt from the country. Each wagon was
  drawn by a pair of bullocks driven by a Malay. These drivers were bright-eyed,
  smart-looking men, with nothing on but a cloth around their loins, and no covering to
  their heads. They sat on the tongues of the wagons, and I was much amused to see that
  when they wanted the bullocks to turn a corner they twisted their tails, and the
  obedient beasts at once went in the direction indicated.</p>

  <p>I saw a great drove of goats passing along, as many as four hundred, and men from
  all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span> countries in
  great variety of dress. Singapore is a very busy place, being the chief city of the
  Straits Settlements, whence comes a larger part of the tin used in such immense
  quantities all over the world. The familiar ingots of tin were to be seen on the
  streets and sidewalks and being trucked towards the big steamers.</p>

    ON BOARD THE "KAISAR-I-HIND."</h3>

  <p class="place"><span class="smcap">Steamer "Kaisar-i-Hind," off Sumatra,</span><br />
  Dec. 13, 1889.</p>

  <div><img class="drop_cap" src="images/rw064.jpg" width="115"
  height="145" alt="" /></div>

  <p class="drop_cap">AFTER mailing letters on the 10th instant at Singapore we went on board
  the steamer at 4 <span class="smallcap">P.M.</span>, and started again on our voyage. We
  were then only forty-five miles from the equator, and though the thermometer recorded
  only eighty degrees, it seemed much as if it were over a hundred. However, as soon as
  the steamer got under way it was quite comfortable. After a day and two nights we
  arrived at Penang, and at 9 <span class="smallcap">A.M.</span> went ashore, and all took
  carriages for a drive through one of the prettiest and hottest towns in the world. We
  were driven along wide, beautifully paved, clean streets for three miles to a
  water-fall and a botanical garden, and it was a drive well worth having. On both sides
  of the road were plantations<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg
  58]</a></span> of cocoa-nut trees, bearing ripe fruit, and once I saw a large nut fall
  to the ground with a dull thud.</p>
</div>
  <p>Our tough little horse, driven by a black man from India, trotted along very fast.
  The road was lined with many strange trees laden with fruit, and the fields near by
  were covered with brilliant flowers.</p>

  <p>We got out of the carriage at the botanical garden and walked about for a short
  time, but were glad to get in again, as the sun was intensely hot. Returning we
  traversed the same beautiful road, viewing the cocoa-nut trees, the mango, and many
  strange and beautiful fruits and flowers.</p>

  <p>Workmen were engaged getting out stone and paving the roads, their black backs
  shining in the hot sun. Here we saw travelling on the road many gayly dressed Indian
  women, with bright silver ornaments on their arms and in their noses. We drove around
  the soldiers' barracks and hospitals and through the handsome streets of the town, and
  at ten o'clock took a boat to the steamer, much pleased by our little trip ashore,
  which gave us a change before starting on the voyage for Colombo. We steamed away once
  more, and soon after lunch, while I was reading<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59"
  id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span> in my state-room, I heard a commotion on deck, and,
  running up, reached there just as the captain did. "Man overboard!" was the cry, and
  the sailors were crawling into a boat like cats. The second officer was already there,
  and in two minutes the boat was lowered into the water, and was off. I looked over the
  side of the vessel and saw that a patent buoy and a life-preserver had been thrown
  over. With a glass I could see the black fellow swimming for the buoy, which he soon
  reached, and shortly afterwards the boat picked him up and returned with him to the
  ship in just eighteen minutes from the time she left. Wonderful discipline was
  displayed, not a loud word being spoken. After the boat was hauled up the captain
  touched a bell, and away we went again.</p>

  <p>The patent buoy before mentioned had attached to it a tin box, containing some
  sandwiches and a small flask of whiskey, which the rescued sailor had confiscated
  before the arrival of the boat.</p>

  <p>At four o'clock one morning a boy called me to get up and see the famous Southern
  Cross. I at once joined the company, and looked upon four stars, which formed
  an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span> immense and
  perfect cross, very beautiful to behold. It was a splendid night, the bright moon
  shining on the water, and countless stars above, many of which are never seen except in
  this latitude.</p>

    COLOMBO.</h3>

  <p class="place"><span class="smcap">Colombo, Ceylon</span>, Dec. 18, 1889.</p>

  <div><img class="drop_cap" src="images/rw068.jpg" width="115"
  height="152" alt="" /></div>

  <p class="drop_cap">SIX days from Singapore, we arrived here on the evening of the 16th
  instant, and at once went to our rooms at the Grand Oriental Hotel, which had been
  engaged some weeks in advance. Colombo is the capital of Ceylon, and has a population
  of one hundred and twenty thousand, and many large and handsome buildings.</p>
</div>
  <p>As we passed along the coast last evening immense groves of cocoa-nut trees were
  seen from the vessel, extending along the shore for thirty miles or so. It was the
  hottest weather yet experienced, not more than eighty degrees, as shown by the
  thermometer, but very oppressive.</p>

  <p>This morning, after an excellent breakfast at the hotel, I went with all the party
  on a drive in and around the city. It was dreadfully<span class="pagenum"><a name=
  "Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span> hot, and we had about such an entertainment
  as one might expect driving around New York or Chicago streets on a July day, with the
  thermometer at ninety degrees. The streets and roads are clean, wide, and in perfect
  order. We stopped at a large market, where the natives crowded around us, and where
  were tropical fruits of many kinds, some of which I had never heard of before. We
  passed many groves of cocoa-nut and banana trees laden with fruit, public and private
  buildings, and large and handsome bungalows, churches, and schools, but the people who
  crowded the streets were the most interesting to see&mdash;Indians, Malays, Singhalese,
  and Chinese, dressed in their native costumes, all industrious, orderly, and civil.</p>

  <p>We called upon Arabi Pasha, who was banished from Egypt some years ago for heading a
  rebellion against the Khedive. His residence is a fine bungalow, surrounded by handsome
  grounds. He is a portly gentleman of about sixty-five years, speaking good English, and
  appeared very glad to see us. We spent a short half-hour talking with him, and then
  took our leave and continued our tour around the city. We saw numerous<span class=
  "pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span> shops and plantations once
  more, and studied the remarkable people we met, and were especially interested by the
  young children swarming in the streets everywhere, and looking like little animated
  bronze statues.</p>

  <p>We went through a fine museum and saw a great collection of historical objects
  belonging to Ceylon, one being a rudely sculptured figure of a lion carved in stone
  three hundred years ago.</p>

  <p>This island is the great producer of the ruby, sapphire, and pearl, dealers in which
  have stores near, and are allowed to come around the hotel. They are very troublesome
  in their attentions, and, as is common among merchants in this part of the world, ask
  two or three times more than they expect to get for their goods.</p>

  <p>I intended to go up to the mines, fifty miles off, where they obtain the ruby and
  sapphire, but was prevented from doing so. I also wished to see the divers go after
  pearl-oysters, but a couple of weeks ago one of them went down in the water and never
  came up, a shark having caught him. Since this accident none of his companions can be
  induced to do any diving, and for the present<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64"
  id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span> the industry, which is a very large and important one,
  is paralyzed.</p>

  <p>There are no fat people in this country, and no drunkards. In a Buddhist temple,
  which I saw yesterday, was a painting of a drunkard. The culprit was represented in
  hell, enduring great agony, being pierced with daggers, and the ugliest-looking devil,
  with tusks like fish-hooks, standing over him, about to pull his teeth with big
  pincers. Any follower of Buddha looking at that picture would surely join a temperance
  society.</p>

  <p>One morning, accompanied by two friends, I took a carriage and drove seven miles out
  into the country, through the native city, and along perfect country roads, passing
  through wonderful tropical plantations and beautiful flowers everywhere. Men and women
  stared at us as we passed, and crowds of bright, laughing children ran after the
  carriage, begging for pennies. One man had a basket of beautiful pink lotus flowers,
  one of which we bought.</p>

  <p>At length we came to the oldest temple on the island, 2,300 years old, and where
  Buddha himself preached,&mdash;a splendid temple, the walls of which were covered
  with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span> highly
  colored paintings, representing Temperance, Prudence, Fortitude, and Justice. There was
  the usual big statue of Buddha and the usual worshippers.</p>

  <p>The ride was a delightful one, the children numerous and very funny, and beggars
  without number.</p>

  <p>Another day we went by rail twenty-eight miles along the coast to the end of the
  road, the entire distance through groves of cocoa-nut trees extending as far back from
  the water as we could see. Once we passed under a banyan tree, the limbs of which had
  been trained over the road twenty feet high, in shape of an arch, then taking root and
  forming other trees on the opposite side. We spent the day at Lavini, a delightful
  sea-coast hotel, and enjoyed ourselves very much. It was quite a contrast to the hot
  city whither we returned for an eight-o'clock dinner.</p>

    NEWAVA ELIYA.</h3>

  <p class="place"><span class="smcap">Newava Eliya, Ceylon,</span><br />
  Dec. 20, 1889.</p>

  <div><img class="drop_cap" src="images/rw073.jpg" width="115"
  height="153" alt="" /></div>

  <p class="drop_cap">THIS is the sanitarium of Ceylon, 133 miles from Colombo and 6,200 feet
  above the sea level; a cool and delightful valley of a thousand acres or so, surrounded
  by high mountains, with a lake in the middle,&mdash;a very ideal place for a
  sanitarium. The thermometer averages seventy degrees.</p>
</div>
  <p>We left Colombo at 9 <span class="smallcap">A.M.</span> on the 19th instant, in a
  first-class car engaged for the party, and passed over a six-feet-gauge road, built in
  the most substantial manner, with an extra guard-rail in dangerous places. There were
  iron bridges and stone depots at various points, each depot surrounded by a beautiful
  and well-kept flower-garden.</p>

  <p>For the first fifty miles the road passed through a flat country of beautiful fields
  and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span> cocoa-nut
  trees, and then we commenced to go up and around high mountains, the building of the
  road being a great engineering triumph. The road was lined on both sides for a long
  distance with a hedge of the large-leafed spiked aloe, from five to six feet high, and
  impenetrable by man or beast, and then we began to see tropical vegetation in all its
  luxuriant growth. Along the sides of the road and far as the eye could see were the
  blooming lantana, the sun-flower, and many large trees covered with yellow, white, and
  red flowers in great profusion. For the first time we saw tea, coffee, and cinchona
  plantations, the mountains being often covered to their tops with tea-plants, sturdy
  bushes about two feet high, and I should say that from the time we commenced to see
  them there were many thousand acres.</p>

  <p>From time to time we could see the natives in parties of fifty or more picking the
  leaves and putting them into large baskets and carrying them on their heads to the
  dry-houses, or depots, and very picturesque they looked in their petticoats of many
  colors, their bare backs glistening in the sun. The natives have on petticoats when
  they wear any thing. Generally they are bare-headed, but<span class="pagenum"><a name=
  "Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span> sometimes sport gay-colored turbans. They are
  a fine race&mdash;bright, sharp, intelligent, cleanly, good-natured, and temperate. The
  women are handsome, and wear silver ornaments in their noses and ears.</p>

  <p>The hotel here is an old vice-regal bungalow, and is like a private house. After
  getting warmed by a wood fire I retired and slept well all night. In the morning,
  before breakfast, I walked out to the woods to see the monkeys, but they did not
  appear, and I did not dare to go far from the trodden path on account of the cobras,
  which abound in these parts. After breakfast we took carriages down the mountain for
  five miles, over as fine a road as any in Europe, to the depot, and to our car, which
  had been retained for us, and soon we were on our way to Kandy, our next
  stopping-place.</p>

  <p>A missionary accompanied us down the mountains, who had been twenty-seven years in
  the country, and entertained us with tales of snakes and elephants, and some account of
  his work in India and Ceylon. Coffee is no longer produced in Ceylon, the trees having
  been destroyed a dozen years ago by an insect, but an immense quantity of tea is grown,
  pronounced to be the finest in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id=
  "Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span> world, and which is largely taking the place of that
  raised in China and India.</p>

  <p>At 5 <span class="smallcap">P.M.</span> we reached Kandy, the ancient capital of
  Ceylon, containing 14,000 population,&mdash;a fine city, with many large buildings.
  There is a lake in the centre one and a half miles in circumference. In the evening we
  visited a large Buddhist temple, erected to hold a tooth of Buddha, which the faithful
  regard as a sacred relic.</p>

  <p>On the 21st we took carriages to the government botanical gardens, said to be the
  finest in the world, and of course nothing like them is possible anywhere, except in
  the tropics. We saw giant palms twelve feet in diameter, stood beneath the deadly upas
  tree and the mahogany, jujube, almond, nutmeg, clove, mango, ebony, and a great grove
  of immense rubber-trees, and saw an immense variety of bright-colored flowers and
  leaves. The gardens cover one hundred and eighty acres, and we spent two delightful
  hours there, after which we drove around the city and through the extensive park of the
  Governor: returning, we took the train at 3 <span class="smallcap">P.M.</span> and arrived
  at our hotel in Colombo at seven, just in season to enjoy the excellent dinner awaiting
  us.</p>

  <div><img class="drop_cap" src="images/rw077.jpg" width="115"

  <p class="drop_cap">CHRISTMAS was a fearfully hot day in Columbo, ninety degrees or more, and
  I did not go out in the morning, except to look into an Episcopal church, which was
  handsomely decorated with flowers, the air being kept cool by fans propelled by natives
  standing outside.</p>
</div>
  <p>After lunch, accompanied by two friends, I drove around the city and some miles into
  the country, over splendid roads. On the road we bought three cocoa-nuts for five
  cents, and opening one, had a refreshing drink.</p>

  <p>We returned at 5 <span class="smallcap">P.M.</span> and at once came aboard this ship,
  one of the finest of the splendid fleet of the P. &amp; O. line. The<span class=
  "pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span> weather, except the
  terrible heat, continues perfect&mdash;not a ripple on the sea, the sunsets splendid,
  and the starlit nights of great loveliness.</p>

  <p>A lady from Hartford, Mrs. Brown, who is well up in astronomy, pointed out to me
  last evening many stars never seen except in this part of the world. A lady from New
  York, Mrs. R. H. L. Townsend, was taken seriously ill on the 23d at the hotel; she was
  confined to her rooms for three days, and had two doctors and a nurse; but just before
  I left for the steamer I was glad to see that she had recovered so as to be able to
  take a drive.</p>

  <p>At the last moment the Captain decided to call at Madras, where we shall be
  to-morrow, long enough to go ashore and see the famous city. Four great steamers left
  Colombo the same evening that we did, one each for Australia, Calcutta, Singapore, and
  Hong-Kong; one of them being a German vessel of immense size, 7,000 tons. On this
  steamer we have all the modern improvements: Edison lights, an excellent table, and
  always plenty of ice. Life on the ocean, as we have it, is very pleasant, and we get
  along nicely, though they tell of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id=
  "Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span> terrific storms which rage here at other seasons.</p>

  <p>The ship is full of passengers, largely English, returning from Australia, very
  nice, kind, and agreeable people. Yesterday a north wind sprang up and it was
  delightfully cool; the passengers were all on deck in groups, a dozen of the stalwart
  young Englishmen playing the national game, cricket; some reading, a lot of children
  playing, and all were happy.</p>

  <p>In the evening we had a delightful concert by amateurs, violin playing by a young
  lady, parts of the "Bohemian Girl" and other operas being rendered in a superior
  manner.</p>

  <p>The ship slowed up so as not to get to Madras before morning, and it was literally
  sailing on a summer sea; the moon sank down behind the waters in a glow, presenting a
  beautiful appearance. I had a good sleep all night, and at seven in the morning looked
  out and saw we were at Madras, between two long break-waters. Soon breakfast was over,
  and we all entered a big row-boat, propelled by ten bare-backed Hindoos; the ship was
  surrounded by a dozen of these boats, the crews chattering and shouting, and on one
  occasion a boy got overboard, but he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id=
  "Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span> did not mind, swam about a short time and then got aboard,
  none the worse for his ducking.</p>

  <p>We could see that there was a heavy surf beating on the beach, but when our boat
  struck the sand, I was lifted ashore by two strong black men, followed by the ladies of
  the party, conveyed in a similar manner. We took carriages and drove about the city,
  which is said to be the hottest in India, but we did not find it so; on the contrary,
  it was very comfortable. We went through the natives' quarters, and evidently they had
  seen white people before, for they paid no attention to us, not so much as we to them,
  as we were looking upon a race new to us. They had marks on their foreheads, showing
  the caste to which they belonged. We visited the markets, and saw that the banyan tree
  was quite common in the squares and along the streets, and passing on to the great
  fort, we looked at the big guns; then we entered St. George's Church, where there were
  many statues of famous soldiers who had served in India and died here. We called at the
  post-office, a large and beautiful building, remarked on the fine roads, the handsome
  appearance of the women dressed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg
  74]</a></span> in bright-colored robes with silver ornaments in their noses and on
  their toes, and then we passed on to the ship, well pleased that we were not to stop
  any longer in such an unattractive place.</p>

  <p class="place">Sunday, December 29, 1889.</p>

  <p>We reached the steamer at noon yesterday; the deck was crowded with native merchants
  trying to sell mats and all kinds of curios, but presently they were driven off to
  their boats, and at noon the ship was put upon her course, due north, everybody
  comfortable and happy, the sea as smooth as an inland lake. This morning we had a
  delightful service on deck, read from the English Prayer Book by the Captain, assisted
  by one of his officers; the singing, by young ladies, was particularly fine, and now
  and again I could detect the sweet tenor of my friend from Manchester.</p>

  <p>Before the service the crew were mustered and reviewed by the Captain. There were
  nearly one hundred of them, mostly Lascars, dressed in white with colored turbans and
  presenting a very picturesque appearance.</p>

  <p>Last evening I was interested to see a lady reclining on a steamer chair on deck,
  and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span> reading by
  the light of a portable electric lamp fastened to the back of her chair. I interviewed
  her husband this morning, and he informed me that it was one of Edison's inventions,
  and that they were now common in London, and cost twenty dollars each. They are four
  inches in diameter, and can be carried in the coat pocket. This one he charges from one
  of the lights on the ship, and it will last fifteen hours.</p>

  <p class="place">December 30, 1889.</p>

  <p>We are still rushing on over a placid sea at a moderate rate, as the ship has never
  made more than 288 miles a day. The thermometer marks seventy degrees, with a light
  breeze from the north, and warm woollen clothing is comfortable. This is a great
  country for learning practical temperance, none of our party having tasted liquor for a
  month, previous experience having shown that they were much better without it.</p>

  <p>I noticed two young men at dinner to-day who drank two large bottles of champagne,
  but they will doubtless find out by experience that such indulgences do not pay in this
  climate. We are only 12,500 miles from New York now, and it seems quite like nearing
  home.</p>

  <div><img class="drop_cap" src="images/rw083.jpg" width="115"
  height="156" alt="" /></div>

  <p class="drop_cap2">WE arrived here yesterday, after a delightful trip from Madras, and at
  once went to our rooms at a first-class hotel, engaged some time ago. Mine happens to
  be a wooden barn-like structure built on the roof of a six-story building, which gives
  me a chance to look down upon the famous city of palaces and immense parks&mdash;a
  great show, particularly at night, when the streets are illuminated by gas and
  electricity.</p>
</div>
  <p>We were told that Calcutta was a dreadfully hot place, but last night I had my
  overcoat on, and was very comfortable, the thermometer being seventy-two degrees.</p>

  <p>I have just returned from a tramp about the city, and find it one of the finest I
  have seen&mdash;population one million; splendid government and other buildings, great
  parks,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span> fine wide
  streets and sidewalks, and every appearance of advanced civilization.</p>

  <p>The natives are a handsome race, dressed in their picturesque costumes. White and
  native soldiers in brilliant uniforms are to be met everywhere, and the whole scene is
  one of great beauty.</p>

  <p>A royal prince is here to-day, the stores are shut, and a great review of soldiers
  is going on. The rush for rooms at the hotels is so great that I hear of a
  Major-General of the British army who is to sleep in a bathroom near us to-night. On
  the morning of the 2d instant we took a carriage drive around the city, starting at 10
  <span class="smallcap">A.M.</span> and returning at 1.30.</p>

  <p>The Botanical Gardens established in 1792 are very fine and well kept, but nothing
  like the one in Kandy, Ceylon. We saw the famous banyan tree, one hundred years old,
  the main trunk of which is 42 feet in circumference, the crown 850 feet in
  circumference; there being 234 roots which strike down from the branches into the
  earth. These roots and branches become little trees themselves. In the garden were two
  beautiful avenues of palm trees, each a quarter of a mile long. I was much interested
  in a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span> bridge of
  boats that we passed over. It was twelve hundred feet long and seventy feet wide,
  rising and falling with the tide sixteen feet. I have seen several bridges made of
  boats in different parts of the world, but none so large and substantial as this.</p>

  <p>We went in the afternoon to the great fort, and inspected the immense
  fortifications, with their great guns and piles of balls. A marriage had just taken
  place in the garrison church, and the party were out on the lawn waiting for the
  arrival of carriages. The brilliant uniforms of the officers and the handsomely dressed
  ladies made a fine show. The church is an exceedingly beautiful one, with many costly
  monuments erected to keep in memory the glorious deeds of England's heroes, statesmen,
  and scholars.</p>

  <p>In the great Cathedral there were many splendid monuments, one to the good Bishop
  Heber, a name dear to the hearts of all Christians for the beautiful hymn he wrote,
  "From Greenland's Icy Mountains," and though I have heard it sung in many churches all
  over the world, it always seems fresh, inspiring, and beautiful.</p>

  <p>There was a beautiful monument to Lord Elgin, who was Governor-General of
  India,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span> and
  before that, of Canada, in whose history I had a personal interest, having seen him and
  obtained from his hands a marriage license at Montreal in 1847.</p>

  <p>We went to a public building, in the yard of which was marked out the size of a
  prison known as the Black Hole. It was underground, 18 &times; 25 feet, where the 20th
  of January, 1756, one hundred and forty-six persons were confined, and the next morning
  only twenty-three were alive. In one of the churches near was a monument erected to the
  memory of Job Charnock, a sailor, who, before Calcutta came into the possession of
  England, came ashore with a boat-load of companions to see the sights. They saw a widow
  placed on a funeral pyre all ready to ignite and burn her alive, which was the custom
  in those days. The natives set fire to the wood, which was too much for the gallant
  sailor; so he rushed in and saved the woman, and, it is related, subsequently married
  her, and settled down as a merchant in Calcutta, where he became rich.</p>

  <p>Returning along the road beside a park a mile or two long we met many fine
  turn-outs, containing Indian and English nabobs, and among them was a coach and four
  with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span> the widow
  and children of the late King of Oude, who were taking an airing. The ladies and
  children were in very gay costumes, and looked exceedingly pretty. The show was a very
  brilliant one, far surpassing any thing of the kind to be seen in any other
  country.</p>

    DARJEELING.</h3>

  <p class="place"><span class="smcap">Darjeeling, India</span>,<br />
  Jan. 4, 1890.</p>

  <div><img class="drop_cap" src="images/rw088.jpg" width="115"
  height="145" alt="" /></div>

  <p class="drop_cap">AT 4 <span class="smallcap">P.M.</span> yesterday we left Calcutta, passing
  through the city, which was everywhere decorated for Prince Victor, who will be a king
  of England, if he lives, and who was to arrive at the same hour we left. We took
  possession of the car engaged for us, and I noticed that the next one was engaged by
  two Indian princes, their names being on the car. Presently they appeared, handsomely
  dressed in long colored robes and turbans, and soon after there arrived two palanquins
  carried by coolies, and completely shut up, containing their wives. They held up a
  carpet screen to prevent outsiders from getting a look at the women, but I caught sight
  of two figures, completely covered from head to foot with white garments,
  getting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span> out of
  the palanquin into the car. The car-blinds were instantly drawn down. I was much
  interested, it being my first look at Mohammedan women.</p>
</div>
  <p>After a tolerable night's sleep in the car we crossed the Ganges on a ferry-boat,
  and then took a narrow-gauge, two-feet-wide railroad, called the Darjeeling and
  Himalaya, which is perhaps one of the greatest feats of engineering skill in the world.
  It is run mainly on a cart-road previously built, and cost only fifteen thousand
  dollars per mile, and is fifty miles long.</p>

  <p>We passed through a flat country for some miles, and then commenced to go up,
  around, through, and over mountains with terrible-looking precipices, now on one hand
  and now on the other. It has been a bright and splendid day, one in a hundred they tell
  us. We were in an observation car, and we consequently could see every thing to the
  best advantage. Elephants were at work in the fields on the plains, and immense tea
  plantations lined the hills and mountains.</p>

  <p>At 4 <span class="smallcap">P.M.</span> we reached our destination, 7,400 feet high and
  looked upon the mighty Himalayas, four ranges rising each one above the other, the two
  highest covered with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg
  83]</a></span> snow, and the one most remote appearing to be fifty miles off, one of
  the peaks of which is the famous Mount Everest, the highest mountain in the world. The
  atmosphere was exceptionally clear, and the panorama spread before us was magnificent,
  and would require the poetical pen of Bayard Taylor to do it any thing like justice. We
  were soon in our rooms at an excellent hotel, which had been engaged as usual. Mine had
  an open coal-fire and a man soon brought a delicious cup of tea and some toast which
  were very welcome. I could hear the jackals crying in the near woods. The country is
  thickly populated and highly cultivated, the people bright and smart but clothed in
  rags and looking very poor, beggars being everywhere. Darjeeling is the sanitarium of
  Bengal. There are several hotels, and numerous fine dwellings scattered along on the
  mountain sides, and far up there are large barracks and hospitals for soldiers. We
  remained two days, and on the morning of the second day Mr. Kolish, Mr. Jackson, and I
  became ambitious to see Mount Everest from a nearer point of view and in all its glory,
  so we were called at 5 <span class="smallcap">A.M.</span> On getting out I found my two
  friends mounted, but the ugly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg
  84]</a></span> beast waiting for me did not approve of the excursion, and first tried
  to kick me, and then to bite, but I finally mounted and succeeded in making him
  understand that he had better mind me. Away we went, up the steep but excellent roads
  for an eight-mile trip to the top of one of the mountains. My horse proved a good
  roadster, sometimes trotting and then galloping, and in one and a half hours we reached
  our destination, and looked upon a great range of snow-covered mountains; Everest, the
  monarch of all, was among them, but much to our disappointment, clouds settled about
  the tops of the range and we did not see the greatest mountain in the world.</p>

  <p>We stopped there an hour or so and took our fill of the grand sight, and then rode
  down the mountain at the same fast pace we had come up, for the train left at ten and
  we had none too much time. On our way down we met a Chinese marriage procession. They
  were making an awful din with tomtoms and drums, and a great show with banners and
  flags, which scared my horse, but the good-natured Chinese stopped their noise and we
  galloped on, reaching the hotel at nine, having enjoyed a fine morning ride.</p>

    BENARES.</h3>

  <p class="place"><span class="smcap">Benares, India</span>, Jan. 12, 1890.</p>

  <div><img class="drop_cap" src="images/rw092.jpg" width="115"
  height="153" alt="" /></div>

  <p class="drop_cap">ON the evening of the 10th we left Calcutta, travelled all night, and
  reached here at 1.30 <span class="smallcap">P.M.</span> yesterday. The railroads in India
  are mostly six-feet gauge, substantially built, but very slow, twenty-five miles an
  hour being the usual speed.</p>
</div>
  <p>We brought along our own bedding, and stopped at stations for meals, every thing
  being very primitive compared with accommodations found in America or Europe. We passed
  through a country thickly populated, the fields being highly cultivated, and planted
  with wheat, rice, cocoa-nuts, etc. Parrots were flying about in flocks, or perched on
  the telegraph wires. Elephants could be seen in the fields, and bullocks were
  everywhere drawing carts or ploughing.</p>

  <p>The two days we have been here have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id=
  "Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span> been very active ones, seeing the wonders of this "Holy
  City." Yesterday morning, at seven o'clock, we went out on the Ganges in a big boat.
  Splendid palaces were along the shore for a mile or two, and thousands of pilgrims from
  all parts of India and beyond were bathing and praying. At length we came to the
  cremation places. The boat stopped within fifty feet of the shore, and we saw the
  bodies of four dead persons in different stages of the process of cremation: one where
  the ashes were being swept into the river, and another just being brought down; this
  one was covered with a red cloth, showing, as they said, that it was a female. The men
  who carried the body first dipped it into the water, and then placed it on a pile of
  wood and brush, and set fire to it. Each of the other two piles of wood had a body on
  it, and both were being burned.</p>

  <p>Passing through the city to Clark's Hotel, where we were stopping, we had plenty of
  evidence that Benares sustained its reputation of being the most filthy city in India.
  The Hindoo temples were especially dirty, though some of them had gilded domes, and
  one, where there was a sacred cow, was the most filthy of them all.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span></p>

  <p>A Vienna friend asked me if I would not like to call on the Maharajah of Benares, he
  being the ruler of the province, and behind his throne being the Governor-General of
  India. I said yes, and we sent our cards to the palace and asked an interview. An
  officer called, I suppose to look us over, and after asking some questions said that
  His Highness would be pleased to see us at one o'clock, and at that hour the same
  officer called again, and we went to the palace in a carriage, and were at once shown
  up to the second story, where we were met at the door by the Maharajah, a young man
  thirty years old and very fine-looking. He spoke English, and shook hands and welcomed
  us very politely. He was dressed in brown velvet breeches, coat of yellow silk covered
  with silver stars, cap of the same, and gold-embroidered shoes; and was smoking an
  immense pipe with a stem twenty feet long. He led the way to an interior hall,
  splendidly furnished in Oriental style, and showed us to a seat. We had a conversation
  of about half an hour, during which I took occasion to tell him something of our
  country, and invited him to come to New York. He said he would be very glad to
  see<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span> America, and
  thanking us for calling said he was sorry we could not stay some time in his dominions.
  He then shook hands and said good-bye, directing an officer to send us books about his
  province. Nothing could have been more polite and kind than his attentions to us. I
  think it proper to say that my republican pulse did not beat any quicker on seeing such
  a magnificent palace and potentate, though I never saw the like or read of such scenes
  except in the "Arabian Nights."</p>

  <p>In the afternoon the party took another drive around the city, and while the others
  were examining an extensive embroidery factory, I sat in the carriage in the
  market-place, and was much entertained by various aspects of Oriental life.</p>

  <p>Once a little prince came along, mounted on a splendid horse, led by a man dressed
  in red robes and with a red turban on his head. The little lad was dressed in robes
  embroidered with gold, and altogether the scene was one not to be witnessed anywhere
  except in this country, or at the theatre.</p>

  <p>We drove to an ancient city some distance off, and saw several old palaces; passed
  through great groves of mango trees and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id=
  "Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span> plantations of beans, peas, wheat, rice, etc. Natives,
  beggars, and children in great numbers crowded around our carriages. We met a regiment
  of native cavalry with white officers and a fine band of native musicians.</p>

  <div><img class="drop_cap" src="images/rw097.jpg" width="115"
  height="156" alt="" /></div>

  <p class="drop_cap2">WE arrived here at twelve last night, after a tedious ride by rail, and I
  was up at seven this morning, and have been all day seeing the wonders of the city.</p>
</div>
  <p>Since a visit to the field on which the battle of Waterloo was fought, I have never
  spent a day of such absorbing interest as this, for here Lawrence, with one thousand
  eight hundred men, held the fort against fifty thousand rebels for six months, and up
  the road we saw came Sir Colin Campbell and Havelock's army of relief. The buildings
  are riddled with balls, and we saw where Lawrence fell and the room where he died, July
  4, 1857. Nothing could be more thrilling than to hear many incidents of the siege
  related in an admirable manner by a native guide.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span></p>

  <p>We spent some hours in wandering about the building and ground held by the English,
  and especially examined the big cannons, in front of which five hundred rebels were
  blown away and killed.</p>

  <p>We went to a fine Mohammedan mosque, one of the minarets of which was covered with
  gold, and would make an architectural sensation if placed in any city in Europe or
  America.</p>

  <p>In the afternoon we took another ride and saw a walled enclosure of twenty acres or
  so, where Havelock and his Highlanders made a breach in the high wall, shot two
  thousand rebels in four hours, and buried them on the spot.</p>

  <p>We stopped at various mosques and public buildings, and reached the hotel at 5
  <span class="smallcap">P.M.</span></p>

  <p>It is a fearfully dirty place, and the sun of India, here as elsewhere, is intensely
  hot, but the evenings are quite cool. I saw many elephants and camels in the streets
  to-day, though horses and bullocks are generally used, and fine carriages drawn by
  horses are a common sight.</p>

  <p>We have seen Lucknow pretty thoroughly, though one might spend a week here to
  advantage, especially in visiting the museum,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92"
  id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span> where there are ancient and modern curiosities of the
  highest interest, and the mosques, which are exceedingly beautiful, in great contrast
  to the filthy Hindoo temples. One especially reminded me of St. Mark's at Venice.</p>

  <div><img class="drop_cap" src="images/rw100.jpg" width="115"
  height="145" alt="" /></div>

  <p class="drop_cap">AT ten this morning we arrived here, and have seen all the places where
  such frightful massacres took place during the Sepoy rebellion of 1857. Mr. Lee, who
  now keeps a hotel here, acted as our guide, and pointed out the various localities. He
  was a non-commissioned officer, and accompanied General Havelock's army, which arrived
  two days after the massacre, and inflicted upon the rebels the terrible retribution of
  fastening several hundred of them in front of the big cannon and blowing them into
  pieces.</p>
</div>
  <p>Mr. Lee pointed out the exact spot where these executions took place, and showed how
  the poor wretches were fastened to the mouths of the cannon. It will be remembered that
  General Wheeler, commanding the British troops, after defending the fort for weeks
  against a great army of rebels, was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id=
  "Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span> induced to surrender under promise of protection from Nana
  Sahib, who collected the prisoners on the banks of the Ganges and had them massacred.
  Only four escaped. General Wheeler was seventy-two years of age, married to a native
  woman, and had by her seven children. He believed that Nana Sahib would keep faith with
  him, but he and all his officers were collected on some steps leading down to the water
  of the Ganges, and at a signal from Nana they were all shot down and killed. One of
  General Wheeler's daughters committed suicide by jumping into a well, and another
  married a native and is now alive here.</p>

  <p>When the rebellion was conquered Nana Sahib could not be found, but Mr. Henry
  Balantine, now U. S. Consul at Bombay, states that the monster escaped to one of the
  countries in the north part of India and died there of cholera. Murphy, one of the men
  who escaped in a boat, had a singular fate. After the rebellion he was made custodian
  of the public buildings here; but one day he killed a native and was obliged to leave
  for China, and has never been heard of since.</p>

  <p>Like many other places in India, Cawnpore is fearfully dusty, the hotel very poor,
  and one is glad to get away.</p>

    AGRA.</h3>

  <p class="place"><span class="smcap">Agra</span>, January 17, 1890.</p>

  <div><img class="drop_cap" src="images/rw102.jpg" width="115"
  height="156" alt="" /></div>

  <p class="drop_cap2">WE left Cawnpore at five o'clock on the morning of the 15th. The train was
  delayed, and I wandered about the chilly depot and caught a bad cold. We were several
  hours on the train looking out upon the Oriental scenery, the people, and the wild and
  domestic animals near by, and at a distance we saw elephants, camels, droves of small
  donkeys, big black goats, and long-legged pigs, flocks of paroquets and green parrots,
  now and then a deer or antelope, and the usual remarkable trees and flowers.</p>

  <p>I arrived here well fagged out, but a good night's rest made me all right again, and
  I have put in two days of hard work, which I regard as among the most remarkable of my
  life.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span></p>

  <p>We saw many magnificent palaces and mosques, the description of which would alone
  fill a large book, and I have space only to refer to the T&acirc;j-Mahal, which has
  been regarded by all who have seen it for the last two hundred years as the most
  remarkable building of its kind ever erected, and one of the wonders of the world.</p>

  <p>Built by the Emperor Shah Jahan as a tomb for his wife, it is of pure white marble,
  186 feet square, the centre dome being 50 feet in diameter by 80 feet high.</p>

  <p>At the four corners stand four towers, each 137 feet high. The architect came from
  Venice, and his name was Geronimo Verrone.</p>

  <p>On the front gateway is the date, 1648, marking the completion of the building,
  which was twenty years building, and cost ten millions of dollars, nothing being paid
  to the twenty thousand workmen, who were said to have been employed in its
  construction, except an allowance of corn daily, and even this was carefully curtailed
  by rapacious officers, causing frightful mortality among the men. Jewellers were
  brought from Italy, and they inserted in the marble walls, both inside and out, in the
  shape of vases and flowers, diamonds, rubies, sapphires, and<span class=
  "pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span> other precious stones. The
  more valuable ones were stolen, but since the English have had possession they have
  inserted artificial ones, and we could see what a magnificent show it must have
  been.</p>

  <p>The remains of the emperor were placed in a tomb by the side of those of his beloved
  wife. Each tomb had precious stones inserted in the marble, and on the top of one I saw
  a place where a ruby two inches in diameter was said to have been taken out. Ordinary
  stones, such as the cornelian and amethyst, were still there. We lingered about the
  beautiful building for many hours, admiring it from every point of view. My friend, Mr.
  Jackson, sang a little song under the great dome, which echoed and re-echoed, producing
  a remarkable effect.</p>

  <p>I have been so much impressed with the marvellous beauty of the T&acirc;j that I
  have purchased an alabaster model of it, and having packed it carefully hope to get it
  home safely. On the opposite side of the river from the T&acirc;j we were shown the
  foundation of a building which the emperor intended to erect for his own tomb, and to
  connect the two by a bridge of solid silver twelve hundred feet long, but the tale they
  told us was that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
  the emperor's son shut his father up in a prison palace for several years, and there he
  died at ninety-four years of age.</p>

  <p>The emperor, knowing that he was about to die, asked to be taken to a marble
  summer-house, from which he could see the T&acirc;j. They carried him there, and on the
  spot where we stood he took a last look at the beautiful building, and died. I know no
  more touching tale in all history, and it being well told on the spot by one of the
  guides, was very impressive.</p>

  <p>This city, like most others we have seen in India, is very dirty, and we are put to
  many trials and discomforts, especially in eating, for we cannot get what we want, the
  hotels being very indifferent from an American point of view.</p>

  <p class="drop_cap">YESTERDAY at noon we left Agra, passing over the river by a fine iron
  bridge, from which we had another view of the beautiful T&acirc;j, which was lovely
  beyond expression. We had an English compartment car to ourselves, and were very
  comfortable. Highly cultivated fields and frequent great barren plains, with now and
  then an elephant, were to be seen, and once a long caravan of camels. Monkeys were in
  the woods, and flocks of parrots flying about, and often the beautiful peacocks were
  perched on the fences or wandering about the fields.</p>
</div>
  <p>It will be remembered that the Hindoos consider all animal and bird life sacred, and
  never kill them, and consequently we see them everywhere.</p>

  <p>We passed on at the rate of about twenty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id=
  "Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span> miles an hour, having forty-three carriages and over a
  thousand passengers, mostly natives, and stopped at a station at 1 <span class=
  "smallcap">P.M.</span> for lunch. The stations in India are all large, this one being more
  than a thousand feet long, and there were collected in it more than a thousand pilgrims
  bound for the sacred Ganges with their bags and bedding.</p>

  <p>I went among them accompanied by the native guide, and saw that many of them carried
  painted poles, from the top of each of which was suspended a bag containing the ashes
  and bones of some relative, which they had brought from their far-off homes, and were
  taking to the Ganges to be thrown into the (to them) sacred river.</p>

  <p>I looked at a group of handsomely dressed women. Among them was a bride, who had a
  profusion of silver ornaments in her nose and ears, and on her arms and toes. My
  appearance among this party seemed to entertain them very much, judging by their looks
  and their chattering.</p>

  <p>We passed through great fields of the castor-oil plant, cotton, and mustard, and at
  9 <span class="smallcap">P.M.</span> rolled into the big station here, and were soon at
  the hotel enjoying the comforts of a wood fire.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span></p>

  <p>This is the most dreadful climate I know of&mdash;eighty degrees to ninety degrees
  during the day, and down to sixty degrees at night. The hotels have rooms only on the
  ground-floor, which is paved with stone, and any thing but comfortable.</p>

  <p>This city has great historic interest, having been ravaged many times by conquerors,
  beginning with Tamerlane, who burned it, and killed a hundred thousand of its
  inhabitants, men, women, and children.</p>

  <p>Taking a drive, I saw monkeys running along the walls, and was everywhere beset by a
  great lot of beggars, dancing girls, and merchants wanting to sell shawls, jewelry, and
  many other articles.</p>

  <p>We have been here several days, constantly driving about and seeing magnificent
  palaces, tombs, and mosques. In one of the great marble palaces was a large hall in
  which was erected the famous Peacock Throne in the year 1638.</p>

  <p>The following account of it is given by Tavernier, who, in the seventeenth century,
  travelled extensively in the East, and saw all the wonders that he relates:</p>

  <p>"The largest throne, which is set up in the hall of the first court, is in form like
  one of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span> our
  field-beds, six feet long and four broad. The cushion at the back is round like a
  bolster; the cushions on the sides are flat. I counted about a hundred and eight pale
  rubies in collets about this throne, the least whereof weighed a hundred carats; but
  there are some that weigh two hundred. Emeralds I counted about one hundred and sixty,
  that weighed threescore, some thirty, carats. The under part of the canopy is all
  embroidered with pearls and diamonds, with a fringe of pearls round about. Upon the top
  of the canopy, which is made like an arch with four panes, stands a peacock with his
  tail spread, consisting all of sapphires and other proper colored stones; the body is
  of beaten gold enchased with several jewels, and a great ruby upon his breast at which
  hangs a pearl that weighs fifty carats. On each side of the peacock stand two nosegays
  as high as the bird, consisting of several sorts of flowers, all of beaten gold
  enamelled. When the king seats himself upon the throne there is a transparent jewel
  with a diamond appendant, of eighty or ninety carats, encompassed with rubies and
  emeralds, so hung that it is always in his eye. The twelve pillars also that
  uphold<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span> the
  canopy are set with rows of fair pearl, round and of an excellent water, that weigh
  from six to ten carats apiece. At the distance of four feet, upon each side of the
  throne, are placed two parasols or umbrellas, the handles whereof are about eight feet
  high, covered with diamonds; the parasols themselves are of crimson velvet, embroidered
  and stringed with pearls.</p>

  <p>"This is the famous throne which Tamerlane began and Shah Jahan finished, which is
  really reported to have cost a hundred and sixty million five hundred thousand livres
  of our money [thirty-two million one hundred thousand dollars]."</p>

  <p>The famous and beautiful Cashmere shawls are made in the province north of here, and
  are mostly sold in this city, where there are many storehouses filled with them. It is
  said that it takes the labor of two men a year to make one of these shawls of moderate
  size.</p>

  <p>Wishing to purchase, I went to one of the largest establishments accompanied by
  three friends. The merchant showed me a book in which were written recommendations of
  his goods by Gen. U. S. Grant and Col. Fred. Grant, and among them was one written in
  German, which was translated by my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id=
  "Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span> friend from Vienna as follows: "I have bought shawls of
  this man, and think I got them cheap, but do not offer him a third of what he asks." We
  spent much time looking at a great variety of the shawls, and finally, aided by the
  excellent taste of my friends, Mr. Norris of Baltimore, Mr. Kolish of Vienna, and Mr.
  Jackson of Manchester, I selected two, which I thought very beautiful, and asked the
  price. The merchant consulted two or three of his sharp, bright-eyed clerks in their
  own language and said: "I have not sold a shawl to your party; I sell you very, very
  cheap; you may have those beautiful shawls for 1,400 rupees." Having in mind the German
  gentleman's remarks, I said, "No; the price is absurd; let us go," and we started out.
  Then the merchant followed saying, "Don't go; make me an offer," and I said, "I will
  give you 400 rupees for both shawls." Greatly to my astonishment he replied, "Take
  them; I will send to your hotel." Fearing a substitution or some other trick I said:
  "No; hand them to me, if you please. Here are 100 rupees, and you may come to the hotel
  and get the balance." To this he agreed and the purchase was made.</p>

    JEYPORE.</h3>

  <p class="place"><span class="smcap">Jeypore</span>, January 25, 1890.</p>

  <div><img class="drop_cap" src="images/rw112.jpg" width="115"
  height="153" alt="" /></div>

  <p class="drop_cap">OUR party arrived here on the 23d instant, and permission was obtained
  from the Rajah, who has the reputation of being the most enlightened ruler in India, to
  visit his palaces and grounds; and very magnificent we found them. The palace was very
  large, and fitted up in a costly manner. We were admitted everywhere, except to a big
  building occupied by his three hundred wives. We then went to see fifty elephants in
  different places, each tied by the legs; and then we visited the tiger cages, a dozen
  of them, each containing a savage fellow. We then went to the stables and saw four
  hundred blooded horses from all parts of the world. The custodian in charge of the
  stable said that if I wanted to hunt tigers the Rajah would be pleased to loan me a
  horse, and I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
  would be sure to find a tiger from two to six miles from the city wall. The Rajah was
  good enough to loan us four of his biggest elephants, and in the afternoon we sent them
  outside the city wall with a photographer. We followed in a carriage and had
  photographs taken, and afterwards mounted the elephants, four on each, and rode two
  miles farther to a country palace of the Rajah, and to the ruins of an ancient city,
  where were formerly great castles, reminding one of Germany and the Rhine. We spent an
  hour looking over the castle, which is very costly and splendid. On the road and around
  the palace we were amused by the antics of numerous monkeys and the beauty of flocks of
  peacocks running wild all over, the screaming of parrots, etc. We then mounted our
  elephants to return. The one I was on looked as large as Jumbo. Meanwhile my friend,
  Mr. Jackson of Manchester, who is a great walker and dislikes the motion of the
  elephant, had ten minutes before started to walk to the carriages, a distance of two
  miles. He had nearly reached them, when he met a lady and gentleman, who proved to be
  an English doctor and his wife. They bowed and said "Good-day,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
  but had not passed on ten paces before they came running back. The doctor
  took hold of Jackson and said, "Look on top of the wall!" (a stone wall laid in cement
  five feet high). "And so you went within two yards of yonder tiger!" Jackson looked and
  saw the big head and paws of a large tiger resting on top of the wall, and then he ran
  away toward the carriages. Meanwhile, Mr. Kolish, who was on the elephant ahead, had
  seen the tiger in the field, and shouted to me to look at him, but he went away very
  quickly, and I saw nothing but a movement in the brush. All this took place before we
  knew Mr. Jackson had seen the beast. There were six natives with each elephant, and
  they were much excited and said the tiger must be very hungry, as one seldom came so
  near the city, and he would most likely get a kid or a man before morning.</p>

  <span class="caption">TRAVELLING IN INDIA.</span>
  </div>

  <p>I have been more interested in this city, where I have seen only native faces, than
  in any other in India, and would be glad to spend some weeks here.</p>

  <p>The main avenues are one hundred feet wide, lighted by gas, and having water
  supplied by pumping works. They are lined<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id=
  "Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span> with beautiful public and private buildings, and crowded
  with traffic, numerous caravans of camels coming and going loaded with stone, cotton
  bales, and all kinds of goods.</p>

  <p>This morning we went to the Museum, a large and splendid edifice erected by the
  present Rajah. As an architectural triumph I know of nothing superior anywhere. It is
  of white and colored marble from base to dome; and the contents no adjectives can
  describe. Lovely! charming! splendid! Costly goods from Oriental countries, owned and
  arranged by the Rajah Mahara Swai Madhosingh.</p>

  <p>Over the arched entrance to the exhibition rooms sentences were painted, taken from
  native books; for instance:</p>
<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="stanza">
      <div class="verse">"How much soever one may study science,</div>
      <div class="verse">If you do not act right, you are ignorant."</div>
    </div>
    <div class="stanza">
      <div class="verse">"By contentment make me rich,</div>
      <div class="verse">For without that there is no wealth."</div>
    </div>
    <div class="stanza">
      <div class="verse">"Rectitude is the means of pleasing God:</div>
     <div class="verse">I never saw any one lost on a straight road."</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>
  <p>We are comfortably lodged in a hotel called a bungalow, which is owned by the Rajah
  and conducted by a native. I was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id=
  "Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span> amused at one of the printed notices in the dining-room,
  which was: "If visitors are not satisfied with the food or cooking, they can deduct
  from the bill what they consider fair"; an excellent notice, which I recommend for
  adoption by hotels elsewhere. In another hotel I saw the following: "Guests are
  requested not to strike the servants"; and "Guests wishing ice are requested to give a
  day's notice, and name how much they require."</p>

  <p>I walked up the street to look at a hunting tiger with hoods over his eyes, and tied
  to a tree, and while leaning up against a bungalow gate, a fine-looking young Indian,
  mounted on a splendid Arabian horse, interviewed me, much as an American newspaper man
  would have done: Where did I come from? What was my profession? and What was I in
  Jeypore for?</p>

  <p>I told him something of our country, the number of people, the miles of railroads
  and telegraph wires, the size of New York and Chicago&mdash;in all of which he was much
  interested. I then interviewed him and asked him who he was, and he replied that he was
  Colonel Fyaz, commander of a regiment of native troops. He could talk the
  English,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
  Hindoo, Persian, and Oude languages, was delighted to see an American, and asked me
  where I learned to speak English. He seemed surprised to learn that it was the language
  of the United States of America.</p>

  <p>After a long conversation he asked for my card and invited me to call at his
  quarters, saying that he would be glad to show me about the city.</p>

    BOMBAY.</h3>

  <p class="place"><span class="smcap">Bombay</span>, January 27, 1890.</p>

  <div><img class="drop_cap" src="images/rw120.jpg" width="115"
  height="154" alt="" /></div>

  <p class="drop_cap">LEAVING delightful Jeypore by the evening train, we were two nights and
  one day on the road. It was very cold after dark, so much so that I had to get up in
  the middle of the night and put on my overcoat and shoes.</p>
</div>
  <p>The train went at a speed of twenty-five miles an hour, stopping at stations for
  meals, which were quite good, but the native waiters were of the worst, and all the
  arrangements very primitive compared with the splendid vestibule trains running on the
  Central Railroad from New York to Chicago.</p>

  <p>We obtained accommodations at a first-rate hotel, where I rested for a day, being
  much fatigued by the trip from Jeypore, but towards night I took a walk along a
  beautiful boulevard, and through fine parks for several miles, and was much interested
  in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span> looking at
  the strange and wonderful scenes. The highly colored dresses of the native women, the
  silver ornaments covering their persons; the immense public and private palaces, very
  costly and beautiful,&mdash;all made a great impression on me, and I think that Bombay
  is one of the finest cities in the world.</p>

  <p>There are fifty thousand Parsees in this city, with some of whom I became
  acquainted, and found them to be very intelligent, and was told that they were very
  successful merchants, many of them millionaires. They originally came from Persia,
  where they were agriculturists, but here they are merchants. These Parsees are all
  worshippers of the sun.</p>

  <p>One day we went to their burial-place called the "Towers of Silence," situated in a
  handsomely laid out park. There were three round towers about one hundred feet in
  diameter and fifty feet high, without any tops, and around the edges perched some
  hundreds of black vultures. We were told by the attendant that the dead bodies were
  placed on slats inside these towers and then devoured by the vultures.</p>

  <p>We saw the dreadful creatures all flying<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id=
  "Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span> over to one of the towers, and discovered that a body
  was being carried there by attendants dressed in white. We were not permitted to go
  near the towers, but were shown by an attendant a working model of one of them, and
  exactly how the dead bodies were disposed of.</p>

  <p>Towards evening a band played in the beautiful park fronting the hotel, and I saw
  sights probably not surpassed by any other place on earth.</p>

  <p>The <i>&eacute;lite</i> were out, both native and foreign, in full force, as a
  public meeting was being held in a beautiful building erected by a wealthy Parsee
  merchant, in front of which was his marble statue.</p>

  <p>The building is called the Bombay University, and an officer, whose coat was covered
  with decorations, was delivering an address on higher education. Officers and soldiers
  mounted on fine horses patrolled the streets; companies of Sepoys dressed in native
  costumes marched along; many white children cared for by native nurses, splendidly
  dressed native women, and beautiful English ladies and children passed to and fro;
  carriages and fine horses went by on the road, making a scene of wonderful
  beauty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span> and
  attraction. The city, with its many parks, covers a large space, and is elegant and
  clean, containing more than a million of people, but, strange to say of such an
  important commercial centre, there has been no United States consul here for six
  months, and I had in consequence much trouble in shipping home some boxes.</p>

  <p>I called upon Mr. Henry Ballantine,[1] who had delivered a delightful lecture on
  Cashmere before the Geographical Society at New York last winter, and he was good
  enough to give me such information as enabled me to get my goods off.</p>

  <p>[1] Since the above was written Mr. Ballantine has been appointed U. S. Consul to
  Bombay.</p>

    ON BOARD "THE KHEDIVE."</h3>

  <p class="place"><span class="smcap">Steamer "Khedive," Red Sea, Near Suez</span>,<br />
  February 10, 1890.</p>

  <div><img class="drop_cap" src="images/rw124.jpg" width="115"
  height="153" alt="" /></div>

  <p class="drop_cap">THE morning of the 31st of January was very hot at Bombay, as usual, and I
  only went out to make a few calls, and some purchases, and at 3 <span class=
  "smallcap">P.M.</span> we went on a tender to this steamer, passing two large English
  troop ships just arrived, and several ironclad men-of-war, and looked at the great
  forts on the land where we had before seen two 120-ton Armstrong guns with piles of
  conical balls, each ball weighing half a ton.</p>
</div>
  <p>The harbor is large and fine, and there were at anchor many large steamers and
  sailing craft, but I did not see anywhere the flag of our country.</p>

  <p>On Sunday there was the usual parade of officers, sailors, and servants, 149 in all,
  most of the sailors being Lascars, dressed in white gowns, red turbans, and sashes,
  presenting a clean and picturesque appearance.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span></p>

  <p>The vessel is a fine one, wonderfully clean, and with all modern improvements,
  including electric lights.</p>

  <p>The doctor is a young and handsome man, and spends most of his time with the young
  lady passengers, who seem to require much medical advice. I notice that on most of the
  ships where I have been the doctors are very attentive to the ladies.</p>

  <p>One night I slept very soundly in the upper berth, but in the morning found my room
  flooded from the open port-holes, sofa, floor, and baggage wet, but no great harm done,
  my clothing being hung up. In the morning I knew the sailors were washing the deck, for
  the water leaked through and struck my face, but one learns not to mind such little
  matters when travelling, and I turned over for another sleep.</p>

  <p>It is rather hot on the steamer, thermometer eighty degrees, but the punkas are
  going in the cabin, and we are all quite comfortable.</p>

  <p>We came from Bombay on the steamer <i>Assam</i>, arrived at Aden on the 6th, and
  were transferred to this ship, and unfortunately there was not time for us to go
  ashore, but I think we lost nothing, as it was a poor-looking place, nothing but rocks
  and fortifications.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span></p>

  <p>We now see for the first time the coast of Arabia, big hills evidently of volcanic
  formation, and long reaches of white sand. The native boats crowded around the ship,
  offering ostrich feathers and various things for sale; boys were diving for silver
  pieces thrown into the water, and generally succeeded in getting them.</p>

  <p>The run of four days up the historic Red Sea has been full of interest. One day the
  air was full of locusts flying over from Arabia to Africa, many of them falling on the
  deck. They looked like small birds when flying, but were not larger than katydids, and
  brown in color.</p>

  <p>On Sunday the service was read by a clergyman who preached an excellent sermon. He
  read from the Bible the account of the passage of the Red Sea at a place not far from
  where we were, and the sermon was about it and Egypt.</p>

  <p>The seats at the long tables in the dining-room were filled, nearly all the
  passengers being in attendance. The weather continues perfect, the water smooth and
  looking very blue. Captain Loggin, of this ship, says that on his last trip he had a
  lady passenger who was ninety-one years of age, and<span class="pagenum"><a name=
  "Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span> on a former trip another who was
  ninety-two, both of them very jolly and comfortable, and going from England to visit
  their relatives in India.</p>

  <p>The captain said that on another of his trips, two ladies, strangers to each other,
  were put in one state-room in which were two wash-basins. One basin being a little
  larger than the other, each lady wanted the larger one, and appealed to him. He gave
  the matter due consideration, and finally informed them that the elder should have it.
  As we approach the upper end of the sea it narrows to about three miles, and we have
  good views of both the Arabian and the African coasts, long stretches of sand on both
  shores, and then mountains of volcanic origin, but not a sign of a town or of any
  inhabitants. Early one morning the captain gave notice that we were nearing the Sinai
  range of mountains, and he showed on his chart all the points of interest, and directly
  pointed out the historic mountain itself, situated beyond a range which was near the
  sea, and looming up so that we could see it with the naked eye, and very clearly with
  the glass. The mountain appeared to be about forty miles off.</p>

    THROUGH THE SUEZ CANAL.</h3>

  <p class="place"><span class="smcap">Cairo</span>, February 12, 1890.</p>

  <div><img class="drop_cap" src="images/rw128.jpg" width="115"
  height="145" alt="" /></div>

  <p class="drop_cap">AT 9 <span class="smallcap">P.M.</span>, on the 10th instant, the big steamer
  <i>Khedive</i> anchored at Suez, the Red Sea entrance to the canal; and I was much
  interested in watching the engineers making steam connections to a large dynamo on
  deck. The connections were made by copper pipes and flange joints. In half an hour they
  were ready. Captain Loggin gave the signal, and the stately vessel moved on at the rate
  of six miles an hour towards Port Said on the Mediterranean. The canal is 87 miles
  long, and when completed was 72 feet wide and 26 feet deep, but two years ago it was
  decided to enlarge it to 120 feet wide, 27 feet 8 inches deep. They are now at work on
  the enlargement, as I saw four immense dredgers lying in the canal near Suez, and was
  informed that thousands of men could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id=
  "Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span> be seen during the day at work all along the route.</p>
</div>
  <p>I stationed myself on the upper deck at 9.30 <span class="smallcap">P.M.</span>, and
  remained there all night with the kind and pleasant captain for my only companion, only
  leaving when we were nearing Isma&iuml;lia at six in the morning; and I was amply
  rewarded by sights such as I never expect to see again.</p>

  <p>The five thousand candle-power electric light, with a Mangin reflector, spread the
  rays out fanlike, and illuminated the canal and vicinity for half a mile ahead and
  several hundred feet wide, so that the smallest thing on the land or in the water could
  be seen. The electric rays illuminated the water so that the white-painted buoys, of
  which you could often see three or four at a time, seemed to be lighted from the
  inside, as if made of translucent golden porcelain, and suspended in mid-air. The white
  sand on the banks of the canal might be readily mistaken for snow, and was in one place
  piled up fifty feet high, for a long distance, and the general effect was singularly
  weird, as the great steamer moved majestically on. When we reached the small Bitter
  Water Lake, the buoys were on stands fifteen feet high, out of water, looking as if
  they were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>
  made of silver, the pear-shaped domes like illuminated mosques. Once where there was an
  opening in the sand-bank, the light illuminated a hill some distance off, and it seemed
  as if I were looking upon a great city, with its mosques, minarets, churches, and
  buildings all being destroyed by fire. Several times, when approaching huge dredging
  machines, the electric light seemed to transform them into beautiful flower boats on
  which fairies might be dancing. As we entered the large Bitter Lake, the electric
  lights were put out and the vessel guided by a pilot increased her speed.</p>

  <p>The tide rises seven feet at Suez, and forces the water up the canal to the Bitter
  Lakes, which operate like a safety valve, distributing the water and returning it when
  the tide recedes.</p>

  <p>The Mediterranean being a tideless sea, the water runs naturally through the canal
  to the Bitter Lakes. Most of the commerce of the East passes through the canal, instead
  of around the Cape of Good Hope, as formerly. In 1887 there passed through the canal
  3,137 vessels, of which 2,330 were British, and only three American. I know of no
  greater illustration of the fallibility of human judgment than that the English opposed
  the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span> building
  of this canal. Lord Palmerston said it could not be built, and if done, would never
  pay, or be any good to commerce; and now seventy-five per cent. of the tonnage passing
  through it is British, and it is of immense importance to them, both politically and in
  a business way. But for the persistent energy of M. de Lesseps, it is safe to say the
  canal would not have been built for many years, if ever.</p>

  <p>The average passages through the canal from the Mediterranean to the Red Sea have
  been eighteen hours, Captain Loggin having made the shortest in fifteen hours; but when
  the enlargement is completed, so that vessels may make an uninterrupted passage each
  way, the time may be reduced to twelve hours. The stock of the company has paid as high
  as twenty-one per cent., and I was informed that our steamer, the <i>Khedive</i>, had
  several hundred cases of silk on board, and that she would pay about seven thousand
  dollars transit charges. Every steamer passing through the canal now makes use of the
  electric light; those not having a dynamo on board hire one at Port Said in Suez for
  ten pounds sterling per trip, including two men to run it.</p>

    CAIRO AND THE PYRAMIDS.</h3>

  <div><img class="drop_cap" src="images/rw132.jpg" width="115"
  height="153" alt="" /></div>

  <p class="drop_cap">ON the 13th at 1 <span class="smallcap">P.M.</span> we took the train at
  Isma&iuml;lia, had a first-class carriage and agreeable company. For half the distance
  we passed through a sandy desert, but when we came to the station Tel-el-Kebir, near
  which Wolseley routed the Egyptian army, the country improved, great fields of
  sugar-cane, lentils, grain, and grass were to be seen; men were ploughing, and others
  gathering the crops, assisted by camels, bullocks, and donkeys. In one instance, a
  camel was harnessed to a bullock drawing a plough. The people were everywhere
  industrious, and the fields looked in splendid condition. Very often we saw large
  flocks of sheep and goats, and soon we came in sight of a long arched bridge spanning
  the Nile. After crossing this we entered a fine depot at<span class="pagenum"><a name=
  "Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span> Cairo, where there was the usual clamor of
  hackmen, but our conductor rescued us from these land sharks, and we were soon at the
  Royal Hotel and I found my room, which had been engaged, and directly a package of
  letters and papers were handed to me, which were very welcome.</p>
</div>
  <p>It is as cool here as March in New York, and I have on my regular winter clothing.
  The Red Sea voyage and the weather here have toned me up, and I feel in first-rate
  health. This is one of three fine hotels in Cairo, and is first class in every
  respect&mdash;French cooking, splendid bread and butter, and excellent beef and mutton,
  which have, no doubt, helped to put me in good condition, after the horrors of our
  campaign of the India cookery.</p>

  <p>Mr. Norris sent a telegram to Baltimore last evening at 5.30, and had an answer at
  11.30 <span class="smallcap">P.M.</span>, so that we are all now in touch of home.</p>

  <p>We have been this afternoon through the bazaars to the great Citadel and the grand
  Mosque, where I unfortunately stumbled over a prostrate man praying, with his face
  towards Mecca, and there was a little row, but I apologized and passed on.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span></p>

  <p>Yesterday we started out at nine and did not get back to the hotel until four. We
  went first to the famous museum three miles distant, over the river, and saw an immense
  collection of antiquities, illustrating Egyptian history for six thousand years,
  including the mummies of the great kings, Rameses I., II., and III., and their wives
  and some of their children. Their remains are not pretty to look at, and it seemed to
  me to be sacrilegious to expose them for show in a museum at one franc admission. The
  museum building is very beautiful, having been erected by the Khedive for a palace, the
  same Khedive who was deposed by the English, and is now in exile in Italy.</p>

  <p>One room had marble pillars three feet in diameter and thirty feet high, and the
  whole building is fitted up in the highest style of modern French art.</p>

  <p>We entered carriages and drove over a fine shaded road to the great Pyramids, where
  we arrived at noon. I at once announced my intention of going to the top of the big
  Pyramid, as did also Mr. Kolish of Vienna and Miss Roe of Cincinnati, the others of the
  party declining.</p>

  <p>The old Arab sheik, who has charge here,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id=
  "Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span> appointed three stalwart Egyptians to assist me, and two
  others followed with jugs of water; with one man holding each hand, and another to
  push, we commenced the ascent. The stones were from two to two and a half feet high,
  making the tallest kind of stairs, but the men were careful and good at pulling and
  pushing, and I made rapid progress.</p>

  <p>They stopped twice to rest, and then I found what violent exertions I had been
  making, for I was completely blown, and my mouth and throat as dry as if I had not had
  a drink for a month.</p>

  <p>We rested at each stopping-place a few minutes, and rinsing my mouth with water
  refreshed me; then we rushed on, reaching the top in seventeen minutes. Such had been
  the violence of the exertion that I could hardly speak for fifteen minutes afterwards.
  Mr. Kolish being a stout young fellow got along first-rate, and Miss Roe being strong,
  cool, and fearless came up serenely. From the top the view towards the Nile was of
  unsurpassed beauty; long stretches of country covered with green as far as the eye
  could reach. Farther back was a boundless plain, but all sand and desolation. I
  intended<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span> to
  recite here Napoleon the First's address, "Soldiers of the grand army, forty centuries
  are looking down upon you," but I was so much engaged getting my breath that I forgot
  all about it.</p>

  <p>After stopping on top for half an hour, we commenced going down, one man holding
  each of my hands and another holding a rope which was around under my arms. We got
  along very nicely with only one stop, indeed I think I could have come down perfectly
  well without help from any one.</p>

  <p>There are 250 steps on the big Pyramid, and it is 480 feet high. At one o'clock we
  had a capital lunch, and then started for the Statue of Memnon only a third of a mile
  from the Pyramids. Some camels were kneeling ready to take us, and I mounted one. The
  beast squealed and got up first on his front legs and then on his hind ones, pitching
  me back and forth, but I hung on and got along very nicely.</p>

  <p>The immense statue, partly covered with sand, did not impress me much, but a tomb
  which I entered near by was a wonder. I measured one of the big stones in the wall and
  found it was five feet square and seventeen feet long.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span></p>

  <p>We mounted on camels again and Miss Roe and I had a race across the yielding sand,
  the Cincinnati young lady coming out ahead.</p>

  <p>The beggars crowded around and annoyed the ladies so much that I spoke to the old
  sheik, and he went at them with a whip and scattered them very quickly.</p>

  <p>We returned to Cairo the same way we went, observing on the road large numbers of
  camels, bullocks, and donkeys, and once I counted seven camels loaded with fresh hay.
  Thus ended one of the wonder days of my life.</p>

  <p>Yesterday morning we left here on a steamer, and went up the swift-running waters of
  the Nile, passing numerous palaces, tombs, and all kinds of Oriental buildings, dozens
  of water-wheels run by bullocks, and once a steam-pump and boiler, all raising water
  for irrigation.</p>

  <p>We had a stalwart and fancy-dressed dragoman, but he was of little use. We took
  along a nice lunch and picnicked on the boat, reaching the dock in three hours, where
  we found about a hundred donkeys and their attendants yelling, screaming, and pushing.
  After much trouble we each<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg
  129]</a></span> mounted one of the ugly beasts, and started for the ancient city of
  Memphis, seven miles away. There was a boy with a stick to each donkey, and every time
  he struck, my beast would kick and nearly unseat me.</p>

  <p>A young lady from Boston, Miss Potter, was put in my charge, and several times we
  had splendid trots and gallops on the sandy roads and plains.</p>

  <p>We met strings of camels and donkeys on the way in front, and our cavalcade of
  excursionists, stretched along the sandy road, presented a remarkable appearance.</p>

  <p>Half-way we stopped to rest at a place where an immense marble statue of a king was
  lying in the sand. It was thirty feet long, and five feet across the face.</p>

  <p>The donkey ridden by Miss Potter proved so bad that she changed him for another
  here, and we galloped over the sandy plain unto Memphis, our destination. There were
  half a dozen big pyramids in sight, and the whole country was covered with ruins. We
  were on a high hill, and looked down upon the Delta of the Nile and its cultivated
  fields, a scene of rare beauty, on one side, and on the other, vast sandy plains and
  deserts.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span></p>

  <p>We walked to the entrance of the "Tombs of the Sacred Bulls." The passage-ways and
  tombs are cut out of solid rock and are all under ground. These passage-ways are a mile
  or two long, and thirty feet in diameter. They strongly reminded me of the sewers in
  Paris.</p>

  <p>From these passages, were dug out of solid rock twelve rooms, each containing the
  statue of a "Sacred Bull," each one carved out of the rock, highly polished and covered
  with writing executed in a beautiful manner.</p>

  <p>Each of us carried a candle, and it was very hot, so much so that one of the young
  men came near fainting and had to hurry out. It was a curious and weird scene, fifty or
  more people, each with a candle, wandering about in the dark. After looking at the
  tombs, we all returned to the upper air, and went to the tomb of a great king near by,
  which was under ground, and contained several large rooms, all made of highly polished
  white marble, covered with writing and carvings; processions of men and animals,
  beautifully executed, and in the best state of preservation.</p>

  <p>Mounted on the donkeys once more, men and boys surrounded us, offering all kinds
  of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span> things for
  sale. One young fellow showed me the skeleton of a lady's hand, and offered to sell it
  for a shilling, but I declined. It was a rough ride back to the river, the donkeys
  being very uncomfortable creatures to ride. Once the one ridden by Miss Potter greeted
  some of his friends in a field, and brayed with tremendous energy.</p>

  <p>We were very much fatigued and glad to get to the boat.</p>

  <p>The return voyage was very pleasant, and we reached Cairo at 5.30 <span class=

  <p class="drop_cap">OUR party left Cairo on the 19th, going by rail one hundred and fifty
  miles to Alexandria, and leaving there at 10 A.M. the following day, arrived here by
  steamer this morning.</p>
</div>
  <p>The landing from the steamer was made in boats, and was rather rough, the sea
  running high and there being no breakwater.</p>

  <p>This is said to be the oldest town in the world, and is certainly the dirtiest one I
  ever saw. We drove all about, going first to the house of Simon the Tanner, situated
  near the sea. We saw the tank in which he used to tan his leather, and went on the top
  of the house, where he and his family used to sleep. We then went to the house of
  Dorcas, situated in a grove of orange-and lemon-trees, and I bowed my head to her
  memory, for she not only did good to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id=

  millions of Christian women in all the ages since to do the same, very often in
  associations named after her.</p>

  <p>The oranges raised in and about the town are very large and fine, and much exported.
  Great crowds of Turks, camels, and donkeys were in the market-places.</p>

  <p class="drop_cap2">WE left Jaffa at 3 <span class="smallcap">P.M.</span>, in as fine a landau as
  you would see in Hyde Park, with three horses and a dragoman, and drove along a
  splendid macadam road, meeting and constantly passing camels, donkeys, and
  strange-looking Turks. Soon we came to the Plains of Sharon, perfectly level, and
  stretching off for ten or twenty miles each way, covered with red, blue, and yellow
  flowers. They are said to be the "roses of Sharon" mentioned in the Scriptures, but
  really are a species of poppy. At a distance we saw the high hills and mountains which
  surround Jerusalem. The scenes were of the most thrilling interest, for Solomon often
  passed this way, and over the road were transported the cedars of Lebanon of which the
  great temple was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg
  135]</a></span> built. It was a cool and bracing day, and we had a delightful trip,
  arriving at this excellent hotel at 5 <span class="smallcap">P.M.</span>, and at once
  walked to the ruins of a mosque built in 1099 <span class="smallcap">A.D.</span>, by
  Saladin. The tower, an elegant structure, is still standing. We went to the top of this
  tower, and looked upon a lovely landscape. As far as the eye could see, the plains were
  covered with almond-trees in full blossom, and other trees and shrubs peculiar to the
  country, the big cactus plants being used for fences. As we returned we passed a tower,
  from the top of which a priest was crying aloud for the faithful to pray. Every few
  miles was a guard-house, and horsemen were often met on the road who acted as
  police.</p>

  <div><img class="drop_cap" src="images/rw145.jpg" width="115"
  height="145" alt="" /></div>

  <p class="drop_cap">THE rest overnight at Ramleh, at the hotel there, kept by a German,
  formerly of Buffalo, N. Y., proved very refreshing, and in the morning we took our fine
  carriage, and driving rapidly over the excellent road, reached here at 5 <span class=
  "smallcap">P.M.</span>, having had a very enjoyable trip.</p>
</div>
  <p>Coming near the Jaffa gate our driver ran against a heavy-loaded camel, and caused
  him to tumble almost into our carriage, but he fell partly under it, and the wheels ran
  over one of his legs and broke it. The owner of the camel, a big Turk, when he saw the
  mischief, sat down by the side of the road and wept. The carriage stopped at the Jaffa
  gate, and we walked to the new hotel, a large handsome building of stone, all the halls
  being paved with marble. It was so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id=
  "Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span> very cold that I had a fire made in a small stove in my
  room. Here, as in all the countries I have lately visited, fuel is very scarce and
  dear; that used here was the roots of trees.</p>

  <p>At last the dream of a lifetime has been realized, and I have been on the top of the
  Mount of Olives, to me the most interesting spot on earth. It had been raining, making
  the slippery stones of the streets very disagreeable. Accompanied by an excellent
  guide, I walked from the Jaffa to the Golden Gate, along the street of "Solomon and
  David," and mounted a small good-natured donkey, who carefully took me over a rough
  road to the top of the Mount. Thence I looked upon the scenes so often described in the
  Bible, rendered more impressive to me from the thought that on the very spot where I
  was, must have stood David and Solomon, Christ, St. Peter, Paul, and the Apostles! They
  must have looked down in their time, as I did, upon the winding Jordan, the Dead Sea,
  Bethlehem, and the mountains and valleys beyond. The other view was towards the compact
  walled city. It seemed to me that I could see the great army of Titus encamped on the
  hills beyond<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>
  the Jaffa Gate, preparing to assault it with their battering-rams. The scene was a very
  impressive one. After admiring the beautiful church lately erected by the Russians, on
  top of the Mount, I passed down by another and rougher path, and rode entirely around
  the city, the guide carefully explaining every thing as we rode along. The Mosque of
  Omar, built on the spot where Solomon's temple stood, is a splendid edifice, the
  outside being made of various-colored tiles, and the inside of mosaic work, with the
  most exquisite stained-glass windows.</p>

  <p>At length we got away from this almost enchanted spot and went through the markets
  and bazaars, which do not differ much from those of other Oriental cities: narrow dirty
  streets, small stores, and crowds of long-bearded old men, exactly as you see
  represented in all pictures; women, black, brown, and white, with their faces modestly
  covered, but barelegged and nothing on their feet except sandals; even these were often
  left off.</p>

  <p>We took a carriage and went to Bethlehem, five miles from Jerusalem, and attended
  religious services held in various<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id=
  "Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span> churches by the Russians, Catholics, and Copts. Every
  thing we saw was of great interest, the view from the hill superb, and the people and
  scenes on the way wonderful to behold.</p>

  <p class="drop_cap">HAVING spent two days in Jerusalem industriously sight-seeing, one noon-day
  I took a seat in the fine carriage provided, my only companion being a dragoman, and we
  were soon bowling along over the fine road to Jaffa.</p>
</div>
  <p>The engineers are surveying for a railroad from Jaffa to Jerusalem and the people
  expect that it will be completed in a year. The journey may then be made in an hour.
  The moon came up at 6 <span class="smallcap">P.M.</span>, and as we passed along the road
  through the mountains I saw sights and scenery not to be soon forgotten. I felt safe,
  for every few miles there was a stone watch-tower, occupied by guards, and often we met
  them on the road, mounted and armed with guns. It was a ride of thrilling interest, for
  over this route have passed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg
  141]</a></span> many times the heroes of old, and on yonder field of Sharon, now
  smiling with flowers, was once fought a great battle. The carriage rushed on, and
  half-way we changed horses. Being very cold, I walked ahead for a couple of miles,
  meeting caravans and single camels, and numerous donkeys laden with wood, and men
  coming from the fields with their oxen and their ploughs. The black-eyed natives eyed
  me curiously, but said nothing, and soon the carriage overtook me, and I was so well
  warmed up by my walk that I felt comfortable for the remainder of the trip.</p>

  <p>We were detained for two days at Jaffa on account of the rough sea, which prevented
  steamers from landing, but being in a comfortable hotel, I was content and spent the
  time looking about the ancient city.</p>

  <p>A young Arab offered to sell me a tame hyena for twenty francs. It was nine months
  old, and as playful as a young dog. At last the sea became smooth, and I entered one of
  the heavy boats, and the three strong Turkish boatmen put me over the rough waters in
  good style on board the Russian steamer <i>Poccir</i> from Alexandria bound for
  Odessa.</p>

  <p class="drop_cap">THE steward gave me a very poor state-room below with another man, but I
  handed him a fee, and in the morning he put me in a beautiful cabin on deck, a large
  room, lined with handsome polished wood with two large looking-glasses, and fit for a
  prince or an American to occupy. I could not find a man on the ship who spoke a word of
  English, but I rather enjoyed the novel situation, and got along very nicely.</p>
</div>
  <p>On the 28th instant, in the morning, I came on deck, and found that we had arrived
  at Beyrout, and after partaking of a glass of tea and some bread, I took a boat and
  went ashore, and there engaged an Arab guide. The first call we made was on Mr.
  Bissenger, our Consul, formerly from New York, with whom I had a pleasant talk. We then
  went<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span> along
  the streets lined on both sides with fine stores occupied by English and other foreign
  merchants, and then through the bazaars of the native town. We inspected a fine palace,
  splendidly furnished, owned by a Russian nobleman, who has not been here for seven
  years, but who keeps it open, with servants in attendance, ready to be occupied by
  himself and family at any time.</p>

  <p>We drove out to a handsome public garden, and came back over the famous Damascus
  road built by the French. A fine macadam roadway, over which are run diligences to
  Damascus, eighty miles away, but now it is blocked by heavy snow in the mountains, and
  consequently two hundred travellers are detained in Beyrout. One gentleman tried to get
  through on horseback, but the snow was too deep, and he was obliged to return. The bay
  is a beautiful one; as seen from the city, a range of mountains looming up around it,
  the lower ones being covered with cedars, and the higher, including Mount Lebanon,
  capped with snow.</p>

  <p>It will be remembered that Solomon obtained the cedars from these mountains with
  which he built the temple at Jerusalem. I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id=
  "Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span> had some anxiety about my passport, as it had not been
  endorsed by the Turkish Consul at Cairo, but a fee put into the hands of the customs
  officer was sufficient, and he permitted me to depart without even looking at the
  document. We got aboard the ship at noon, and after a nice lunch, including excellent
  red and white Odessa wine, the steamer whistled, and we were off. During the afternoon
  we stopped at Napoli, which is a well-built town, extending along the shore a mile or
  two, with the snow-covered mountains for background. Here a dozen passengers got off,
  mostly Turks. There was a heavy sea, and the small boats could only be brought up to
  within six feet of the ship's ladder, so the passengers wishing to disembark had to
  jump. The steam engines were kept in constant use from 4 <span class=
  "smallcap">P.M.</span> until midnight, taking on board from lighters three thousand large
  boxes of oranges for Odessa.</p>

  <p>The steamer and the lighters pitched about, and it was a sight to see how skilfully
  every thing was managed.</p>

  <p>The cooking on this ship is excellent, though some of the food is new to me, and I
  look with some surprise to see the Russians<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id=
  "Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span> drink a small glass of raw brandy before each meal.</p>

  <p>We arrived at the ancient and important city of Smyrna yesterday at 10 <span class=
  "smallcap">A.M.</span>, and went ashore with Mr. Zucker, Swiss Consul to Chili, who speaks
  English, and very kindly assisted me in making known my wants.</p>

  <p>We employed a guide and went through the city, which is a large one, containing two
  hundred thousand people.</p>

  <p>The foreign streets and stores are very fine, but those occupied by Jews, Turks,
  Armenians, and Greeks are very dirty and disagreeable.</p>

  <p>After a couple of hours' walking about in the heat and dirt, we came back to the
  street running along the bay, which is a couple of miles long, well-paved and clean. A
  dozen large steamers were at the docks, and much business going on. We saw numbers of
  fine buildings, hotels, and caf&eacute;s.</p>

  <p>Mr. Zucker and I called on the United States Consul, Mr. Emmet, and I was agreeably
  surprised to find that he was an old acquaintance, formerly in the Comptroller's office
  of New York.</p>

  <p>At 4 <span class="smallcap">P.M.</span> we went on board, and were soon off. The
  steamer had been invaded by a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg
  146]</a></span> dozen young Englishmen, and on interviewing them I found that they
  belonged to a foot-ball club of Constantinople, and had been to Smyrna playing against
  a club there. They were a jolly set of young fellows, and made things lively on the
  ship for the remainder of the trip.</p>

  <p>The wind blew hard all day. It was cold and disagreeable, and we saw little of the
  land, though we were passing through the famous Dardanelles, the Hellespont of the
  Greeks, past the site of the ancient city of Troy, of which Homer sung, and I would
  have given much for a bright day or a moonlight night so that I could have seen the
  exact place where "Leander swam the Hellespont." But this was not to be, so I turned in
  and slept until morning, and when I came on deck found that we were at anchor in the
  world-renowned and beautiful harbor of Constantinople.</p>

  <div><img class="drop_cap" src="images/rw156.jpg" width="115"

  <p class="drop_cap">THE harbor appears to be about a mile wide and two miles long, surrounded
  by steep hills, on which the city is built, largely in terraces, with many great
  palaces, mosques, and public buildings, the Mosque of St. Sophia being very prominent.
  I took a guide at the ship and went ashore in his boat. I had been often informed of
  the annoyances by custom-house officials to which travellers are often obliged to
  submit on their arrival in the Turkish dominions, and was agreeably surprised at the
  ease with which I was permitted to go on shore. The guide showed my passport to an
  officer, who looked it over and returned it, and we went to another wharf, where my
  trunk and bag had been landed. There were three venerable officers here, who each took
  a franc<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span> and
  passed the baggage without opening any thing, or saying a word.</p>
</div>
  <p>A big Turk took my trunk and bag on his back, and we went up an ill-paved and dirty
  street, a quarter of a mile long, and almost as hard to climb as the Pyramids of Egypt,
  leading to a nice and well-paved avenue, lined with fine shops, on which was the Hotel
  Pesth, where we found comfortable quarters.</p>

  <p>I had a cup of tea, and then sallied out to see the city. There are few carriages to
  be seen in the streets, but great numbers of large and homeless yellow dogs, all of the
  same shaggy breed, apparently well fed and happy and certainly good-natured. There were
  twelve of these dogs on the walk opposite the hotel, and I counted 164 on one of the
  main streets, about a mile long. We remarked that they were about as thick all over the
  city, and there must be as many as fifty thousand altogether. We walked down a fine
  street to the water, and along the shore for a mile or two, and again admired the
  beautiful bay, which poets have raved about for centuries, and which most people think
  the finest in all the world.</p>

  <p>We went as far as one of the big palaces belonging to the Sultan, which faces
  the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span> water. It
  is twelve hundred feet long, and has two grand entrances built of white marble. There
  we took a circuit around the hills, and saw many great buildings, barracks, schools,
  etc. Once we saw a regiment of horsemen drilling in a large square. The men were tall
  and fine-looking, and the horses excellent. There were two fire alarms while we were
  out, and it was enough to make a New York horse laugh to see the arrangements for
  putting them out. The engine, so called, was an ordinary force-pump with two handles,
  placed on a platform and carried by a dozen men, who were followed by fifty more, in a
  leisurely way. There are no water-works, and many large and very old wooden buildings,
  so one can readily see that there must be destructive fires here sometimes.</p>

  <p>I have been here a week, and have seen many mosques, including the immense and
  famous St. Sophia, which must have been in days of old very magnificent, but it has
  been largely robbed of its treasures, and is now quite dilapidated.</p>

  <p>The weather here is very bad, cold, rainy, and blustering, much as we often have it
  in March. There was a heavy fall of snow two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150"
  id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span> weeks ago, and the streets are wet, slippery, and
  disagreeable. On the 6th instant we made the famous trip up the Bosphorus to the Black
  Sea, which has been so often written about. There were four of us, Mr. Zucker, myself,
  and two friends, all sedate, over sixty years of age, and representing a combined
  weight of nearly eight hundred pounds.</p>

  <p>We left the hotel at 9 <span class="smallcap">A.M.</span>, walked a short distance
  through the middle of the muddy streets to a cable road, which we took, and in ten
  minutes were in a busy street near the water. We then crossed a fine iron bridge and
  went on board a side-wheel steamer. Looking across the water we could see the great
  hospital buildings where Florence Nightingale immortalized her name, by her care of
  wounded soldiers during the Crimean war. Steam was up, and soon we were away, going
  along near the shore of the European side and making about ten landings. On the shore,
  buildings have been erected, sometimes a hundred or more together, so that practically
  speaking the ten miles to the Black Sea is a continuation of the city. Palaces are to
  be seen all along, several of them belonging to the Sultan, and one<span class=
  "pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span> very large and splendid
  one occupied by the Persian Ambassador.</p>

  <p>The ranges of hills near the water are largely cultivated, and even now are covered
  with green grass, the whole presenting a panorama of great beauty.</p>

  <p>We stopped at noon, went on shore and had an excellent lunch at a German restaurant,
  and then took another boat as far as the Black Sea, and returned along the shore of
  Asia, stopping at numerous places to take on passengers and mail, and in an hour
  reached the city.</p>

  <p>There was a lot of women on board, with their faces more or less covered. Once as
  the steamer was passing a house I saw a very pretty sight. A couple of little girls
  made signals to our captain, and a larger one held up, for him to see, a small white
  puppy. The white-headed old sailor smiled a grim smile, and the swift steamer swept
  on.</p>

  <p>One day I took a guide and went to see the famous native bazaars, where under one
  roof were several hundred small stores, the passage-ways narrow, wet, and ill-paved,
  such as you find everywhere in the East, filled with every thing native and foreign one
  ever thought of. An Armenian pulled me into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id=
  "Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span> his store and showed me elegant stuff, sofa pillows,
  silks, shawls, and gold embroidery, but having no use for such things I came away
  without purchasing.</p>

  <p>Another day I called on Mr. Sweeney, our Consul, and later upon Mr. Solomon Hirsch,
  U. S. Minister, who kindly gave me all the information I wanted about Constantinople.
  Returning through the lower part of the city, where there was a large crowd of people,
  I saw a dog-fight. A strange black dog had invaded this part of the city, and a dozen
  yellow ones went for him fiercely, causing an immense row and confusion, until a Turk
  appeared with a big rope, thrashed them all and sent them yelling away.</p>

  <p>One morning we took a carriage, and went to see the Sultan make his weekly trip to a
  mosque. We drove some three miles to the front of the mosque through the mud and
  snow.</p>

  <p>This mosque is a new and beautiful one, and soon after we arrived, there was a great
  gathering of horse and foot-soldiers.</p>

  <p>The horsemen were fine-looking, and rode splendid horses. They formed several deep
  in front of our carriage, but I got on a high fence, so as to have a good view, and
  stood<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span> there
  in the snow and rain for an hour, waiting for his Highness. At length there came a band
  of music, a troop of cavalry, and many decorated officers, followed by an open carriage
  containing the Sultan, a dark, black-bearded middle-aged Turk, wearing the national red
  fez. He passed slowly on to his devotions, and I was asked if I would wait and see him
  return. I said most decidedly not, and returned with my friends to the hotel and to a
  late but excellent breakfast at 2 <span class="smallcap">P.M.</span></p>

    CONCLUSION.</h3>

  <p class="drop_cap">ON the afternoon of the 10th of March, I took a walk down to the great
  bridge, and had a last and lingering look at the splendid harbor, the Golden Horn, and
  the Bosphorus. At 6 <span class="smallcap">P.M.</span>, I took a carriage and a guide to
  the depot at Stamboul, from which leaves, twice a week, the Oriental Express for Vienna
  and Paris.</p>
</div>
  <p>After an examination of my passport and baggage, and considerable delay, I got on
  the train, composed exclusively of Mann boudoir cars, lighted by gas, including
  dining-car; and every thing first-class, quite as good as any thing in America, except
  the vestibule trains from New York to Chicago. The road-bed is so perfectly constructed
  that the cars run easier than on any railroad I was ever on. You could read with
  comfort, and some of the passengers were writing.<span class="pagenum"><a name=
  "Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span> My journey from Constantinople was a
  solitary one, our party having separated, and other friends being left behind. Passing
  through Bulgaria and Servia, little was to be seen except vast plains, sometimes
  cultivated, but often not; mud houses with thatched roofs, and oxen ploughing in the
  fields. We then went up and over big mountains, covered with snow.</p>

  <p>The second morning when I arose we were in Hungary, and the scene had changed to
  every appearance of business and activity. Four oxen, attached to a plough or to a
  four-wheel wagon, were to be seen all along the route. There were vast cultivated
  plains, and beyond them towns, villages, and houses, all looking in good shape. We
  arrived at Budapest after two nights and one day on the train. I spent two days in
  Budapest, and found it one of the most beautiful cities in Europe&mdash;handsome, well
  paved, wide, clean streets, splendid hotels, stores, and public and private buildings.
  This city is the capital of Hungary; the King, who is also Emperor of Austria, resides
  here for a portion of the year.</p>

  <p>In one of my trips about the city, I saw him driving out in his royal coach.
  Leaving<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>
  Budapest at half-past two one afternoon, after a fine journey of five hours, I arrived
  in Vienna, and was accommodated at the Imperial Hotel, which was first-class in all
  respects.</p>

  <p>A week was passed in Vienna. It is one of the most beautiful cities in the world,
  many think even finer than Paris, and I thoroughly enjoyed the comforts of civilization
  once more, all the more, no doubt, from having been partly deprived of them for so many
  months, as recorded in the previous pages. I called on Colonel Grant, the United States
  Minister, who was very polite and kind. I dined with him and his charming family, and
  attended a diplomatic reception given by Mrs. Grant. I also dined with the
  distinguished Dr. Kolish and his family, some of whom spoke excellent English, and
  passed a very agreeable evening with them.</p>

  <p>Passing on to Berlin, I there saw a grand review given by the Emperor to the Prince
  of Wales; and from there went to Dresden, in which delightful city several days were
  spent, going often to the large and splendid gallery of paintings, and lingering in
  front of that wonderful work of art, the "Sistine Madonna." One evening I<span class=
  "pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span> went to the Grand Opera,
  and one afternoon drove around and through the city. Two American young ladies were
  kind enough to accompany me and to point out the various objects of interest. We met
  the King of Saxony, driving out in a showy royal carriage.</p>

  <p>Hamburg came next, one of the most beautiful and enterprising cities in Europe, and
  then Bremen, where I boarded the North German Lloyds steamer <i>Eider</i>.</p>

  <p>Every thing about this splendid ship was so perfect that one could not suggest an
  improvement; the table being of extraordinary excellence. We made a quick passage, and
  in eight days I landed in New York, April 8, 1890, having been absent exactly seven
  months. The distance travelled was 27,816 miles: 18,786 by water, 9,030 by land.</p>
